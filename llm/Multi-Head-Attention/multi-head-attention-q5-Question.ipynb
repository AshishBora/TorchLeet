    "# Implement Attention from Scratch\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is the bread-and-butter of the Transformer architecture. It enables the model to **jointly attend** to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to implement MHA from scratch using PyTorch, simulating exactly what `torch.nn.MultiheadAttention` does â€” projecting Q, K, V for each head, computing attention weights, applying them to V, and concatenating the outputs across all heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Projections for Q, K, V**\n",
    "   - Project input `q`, `k`, `v` into a total of `d_model` dimensions.\n",
    "   - Split them into `num_heads` of `d_head = d_model // num_heads` each.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention per Head**\n",
    "   - Compute attention scores:  \n",
    "     `scores = Q @ Káµ€ / sqrt(d_head)`\n",
    "   - Apply an optional `mask` before softmax.\n",
    "   - Use the scores to weight `V`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combine the Heads**\n",
    "   - Concatenate the outputs of all heads.\n",
    "   - Apply a final linear projection to restore the shape: `(batch_size, seq_len, d_model)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Validate Against PyTorchâ€™s Reference**\n",
    "   - Test your output against `torch.nn.MultiheadAttention` using the same input tensors.\n",
    "   - Check for numerical closeness using `torch.allclose()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- âœ… Use only PyTorch operations.\n",
    "- âœ… Make sure all tensors are reshaped properly when splitting and combining heads.\n",
    "- âœ… Support optional masking.\n",
    "- âœ… Must match `torch.nn.MultiheadAttention` output when heads and shape are aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "  <summary>ðŸ’¡ Hint</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use `.view()` and `.transpose()` to shape Q, K, V to `(batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, d_head)`.\n",
    "  - Softmax should be applied over the **last dimension** (attention scores across sequence).\n",
    "  - Use `.contiguous().view()` to flatten the multi-head outputs back into `(batch_size, seq_len, d_model)`.\n",
    "  - Match PyTorchâ€™s behavior using the same projections and batch-first format.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
