    "# Create Embeddings out of an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to extract **meaningful sentence-level embeddings** using a pre-trained **causal language model (SmolLM2-135M)** on Amazon Reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're working with a **generative language model**, but you‚Äôre not here to generate Shakespeare. Instead, you‚Äôll tap into its **hidden states** to get semantic embeddings that capture the essence of a review ‚Äî the good, the bad, and the brutally honest.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load and Tokenize Text**\n",
    "   - Use the `McAuley-Lab/Amazon-Reviews-2023` dataset (subset: `raw_review_All_Beauty`).\n",
    "   - Load ~10 sample reviews for testing.\n",
    "   - Tokenize them using `\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M\"` tokenizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extract Embeddings**\n",
    "   - Run the tokenized batch through the model with `output_hidden_states=True`.\n",
    "   - Access the **last hidden layer** from `outputs.hidden_states[-1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute Sentence Embeddings**\n",
    "   - Options:\n",
    "     - If the model uses a classification token (e.g., `[CLS]`), extract its embedding.\n",
    "     - For causal models (which typically don‚Äôt), **average the token embeddings** from the final layer, **excluding padding tokens**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Find the cosine similarity for a given keyword** \n",
    "   - Compute the cosine similarity between the average embeddings of the reviews and a keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚ùå Do **not** use sentence-transformers or pre-built embedding tools like `bert-as-service`.\n",
    "- ‚ùå Do **not** generate text (no `.generate()`).\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Use only Hugging Face's `AutoModelForCausalLM` and `AutoTokenizer`.\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Exclude padding tokens when computing average embeddings.\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Ensure everything runs on `cuda` if available.\n",

It also comes in a beautiful gift box so this would make a wonderful gift for someone. I bought another for my mother-in-law and plan to give it to her when we visit next month. Highly recommend!',\n",
       "  \"When I saw this, I was thrilled to be able to try it. I have suffered from bags and dark circles under my eyes for years now. I have been 'using' this for almost three weeks and I am not happy with it. First, it's almost impossible for me to keep it in place under my eyes. They come wet out of the packet and I was unsure what side was supposed to be placed on my skin. They do not stay in place and I found them falling off easily. Of course, maybe it was me or my skin, so please don't just rely on my review (read others). I will not be reordering.\",\n",

I highly recommend this Bellezza styler.',\n",

       "  'To be honest, I rarely have used an overnight cream. Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). So, when I saw this Iryasa cream I wanted to try it. Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now. I highly recommend this cream for women and men.',\n",
       "  \"At first when I saw this, I wasn't sure what this. I looked at the reviews (which were mostly positive) and thought I would give it a try. My skepticism was quickly diminished after trying this for just a few days. I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward. I am really impressed with the results!\",\n",

I have had issues (particularly gums) for the past 5 years. No ones fault but my own for not taking care of my mouth the way I should have all these years. This flosser is great. I fill it with Act Restoring mouthwash and use it after brushing. It amazes me how much stuff this flosser removes with a simple puff of air. Of course, you can purchase both these items separately, but you save in getting them together. Sonicare  makes the best tooth/gum care products on the market bar none!',\n",

But, beyond that, I just don't get i. I stopped using my older Phillips Sonicare to use this for the past two+ weeks. The vibrations on this brush are very small and I find myself pushing the toothbrush into my teeth and scrubbing to be sure they are getting clean. Maybe there is some secret sonic vibration thing going on, but it didn't happen for me. If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case. Without manual intervention, my teeth did not feel clean. As an fyi, I stopped using it this morning and went back to my Phillips.\",\n",

Fragrance is a very personal thing and it can smell differently depending on your body chemistry. I do like the concept of the petals. They're basically scented towelettes.

I wasn't sure what the spritz was for, so I sprayed it on my face after washing it, kind of like a toner, but later I discovered that it's more of a setting spray. The sizes are typical for travel. They're small and should last up to a week, I'm guessing. The individual products seem to be fine. I've used the foaming cleanser before, but the other items were all new to me.

I recently tried a different face oil and found it wasn't a bad step at all. This oil has a nice, essential oil smell to it. The only ingredient that I can detect by smell is the lavender. It's not overpowering, but it is noticeable. The oil absorbs quicker when it's applied to dry skin. I tried it out on the back of my hand and it absorbed nearly right away. When used as the final step in my skincare routine, it took much longer to absorb. It leaves my skin feeling really soft! I haven't had any problems since using it. I personally only use it at nighttime because I don't want my skin looking oily, even for a little while, during the day.\",\n",

I like the variety of colors and have shared these with my eighteen year old daughter. One thing that I do like is that the bow doesn't get off centered as easily as my old one. My old one has to be adjusted every time I put it on. This one seems to be just fine.\",\n",

It has a light, barely noticeable citrus smell to it. It absorbs really quickly but in doing so, I found it to be over drying on my mature skin.

It's thick, like a lotion consistency. The cleanser doesn't lather or foam. I haven't been able to notice any scent, good or bad. It doesn't dry out my skin. I'm very pleased with it.\",\n",
       "  \"'Tis the season for dry hands! I go through a lot of hand creams in the winter months. This lotion is not too thick, but it's not runny either.

It is very moisturizing and leaves my hands soft. I would order this again.\",\n",
       "  \"I've used sonic toothbrushes before. I like the pink color of this. It comes with a travel case and extra brush heads. There are several different speeds/settings that you can use.

       "  \"I am in my early 50's and have been a regular user of anti-aging products for the past several years. This serum comes in a glass bottle and has a dropper applicator. It takes about half of the dropper to cover my face. It has a tacky (but not sticky) feel to it which remains for a while even after it has absorbed into the skin. The microbeads have to be crushed or else you have little white beads on your face. It's not difficult to break the beads. I just press on them and they rub into the skin. After applying the serum, my face was really dry. I have been using this at night. I have a multi-step skin care routine so I followed this with my nighttime moisturizer, then retinol, and some face oil. The serum doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. There is a mild scent, but nothing that I could recognize. Overall, it's okay. I haven't noticed any tightening or improvements in my skin. However, as a regular user of anti-aging products, I wasn't expecting anything new.\",\n",

Originally he was going to use the web based version, but since this comes with a year of enhanced payroll, he decided to go with this. He consulted with an accountant in getting it set up for his company's needs. He did have to contact customer support to help him get the enhanced payroll feature working. For some reason, it had the number 1234567 prefilled and he couldn't change it without customer support. So far it has been easy to use and has done everything he's needed it to do.\",\n",

       "  \"I have been using jade rollers for the past few months. This is my third one. The first one that I bought was much larger than this and I found it to be a bit awkward at times. Plus the end that rolls around the eyes was a static piece, not a roller. Then I tried a smaller one more recently. It was fine, until the eye roller piece broke off. The metal piece that holds it in never felt really sturdy and when it broke, I wasn't really surprised. This one is the nicest one I've tried. It's a great quality and very sturdy. The size is perfect. The directions say to chill it in the refrigerator, but I have found that it's usually cold enough just leaving it out on my bathroom counter. I use it primarily to help my serums and creams absorb into my skin better. This comes with another tool, a Gua Sha, which I was unfamiliar with. They both were in a nice drawstring bag and would be perfect for gift giving.\",\n",

They do an impressive job of removing makeup, especially mascara. They are gently on my skin. These come in a set of 2, plus the set is half the price of the original. I will be ordering some of these for the girls in my life!\",\n",
       "  \"My daughter received a UV Light Manicure Light last year for Christmas from her aunt. It came with a couple of colors, but she is thrilled to have this nice variety of colors now. The quality of the nail polish is comparable to other gel nail polishes that we have bought. It works as it should. She has polished her nails once so far with this set. As of now, it's been one week and they all look as good as the first day. Usually gel polish lasts for about 2 weeks on her, so at this rate, she thinks the results will be the same. One thing she didn't like was that the bottles are not labeled or marked to indicate what colors they are. To solve this, we put a drop of nail polish on the back of each bottle. The polish wouldn't dry without the LED light, which we realized after 5 hours of waiting. So we took a piece of clear tape and covered the polish drop. So now she can easily identify the right bottle without having to open each one.\",\n",
       "  \"I love coffee scrubs. This one is a new favorite. There are two types of body scrubs. Dry ones that are like sand and don't clump together or ones that have a lot of oil that cause it to clump together. This one is a dry one. It comes with a little scoop which is nice. My last dry coffee scrub that I had did not, so it actually was a bit messy to use. The directions say to scrub it on your skin and leave for a few seconds before rinsing. Most coffee scrubs that I have tried say to leave it on for a few minutes which I find to be nearly impossible unless you turn the water off. The smell is amazing - a rich coffee scent that is perfect for slow moving mornings. It does leave behind an ever so slightly oily texture, but it goes away after toweling off and leaves behind soft skin. I haven't noticed any difference in my cellulite, but I have read that caffeine helps with it. I don't use it for the cellulite. I like to use it for exfoliating my skin.\",\n",

But when I do notice blackheads, I use this for a few days until they are gone. The product is white and has a very fine grit to it. The grit scrubs away the blackheads. It does not hurt or irritate my skin. It doesn't take a lot for each use so it should last a while.\",\n",
       "  \"I am in my late 40's and started using anti-aging products a few years ago. Because I have been using products to work on wrinkles and younger looking skin regularly for the past few years, it's difficult to see new results. This eye cream is a nice creamy consistency. I don't notice any smell from it at all. I am able to apply this to the eye area of both of my eyes with just one dispense from the pump. It absorbs nicely into my skin and keeps my delicate eye skin well hydrated. One thing that I especially like is that it doesn't sting my eyes! I have ultra sensitive eyes and if I sweat, make up and skin care products will often get rubbed into my eyes. Some products cause them to sting or burn. We're having a hot summer here in Georgia and even with sweating, I have not had any issues with it stinging or burning. I've had to stop using some of my favorite beauty products in the past for that problem. I'm very happy with this eye cream so far!<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.\",\n",
       "  \"This is the 3rd peel foot mask that I have tried. The others have been unsuccessful. Still wanting to experience the foot peel, I tried again. The first thing that makes this foot peel better than the others is the foot slippers. The slippers are actually a medium thickness plastic. They remind me of the ‚Äúrubber pants‚Äù that my little boy wore over his training underwear when he was 2 years old. These slippers also fit the best of the three that I have tried. I had problems with using the tape, but because my feet are on the larger end, they stayed in place well without it. I wear a size 10 W shoe and these fit my feet fine. They were not too tight nor did I have to stretch them to get them on. They were a little confusing to figure out. The directions said to ‚Äúcut on the dotted line‚Äù but I couldn‚Äôt see any dotted line. The 2 slippers were attached together at the top. So I cut them apart and then I had to snip a little off the top to open up where my foot was to go inside. This foot peel has a somewhat pleasant scent. I was worried because one of the ingredients is vinegar and another is fermented milk. Those did not sound appealing at all. However, what I smelled was a combination of the ginger and the chamomile. The hardest thing about this whole process was carving out the time to do it. You have to soak your feet for 15-30 minutes before hand. Then you have to wear the foot booties for 70-90 minutes. Then soak for another 15 minutes afterwards. I‚Äôm a busy mom, so it‚Äôs hard to find that much free time. I've just started noticing some peeling, so already it's looking more successful than the other ones that I've tried.<br /><br />*I purchased these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review.

       "  \"My daughter and I discovered facial sheet masks over the summer and have become fans of them. They are easy and fun to use. This box of Anti-Aging sheet masks comes with 5 masks. Each mask is individually wrapped. When you open up a mask and remove it from the packing, you see that there are 2 layers. One is the sheet mask which is thin and papery like. The other is a plastic type material. The two layers are together, so I put both of them on my face. The other masks that I have used didn't have this plastic layer. I couldn't get it to lay flat on my skin very well, so I peeled the plastic layer off leaving just the paper one. This was what I was more familiar with. That layer was easy to mold to my face. The mask was very cold which felt refreshing. It's very wet - not to the point of dripping off my face, but enough that you want to spread it around more on the mask as it is on your face. It says to leave it on for 15-20 minutes. I opted for the lesser time because my coffee was ready & I didn't want to wait any longer for it! Then you are supposed to rub any left over &#34;goo&#34; (for a lack of a better word) into you skin. I accidently got a little into my eye, but it didn't burn or sting at all, which surprised me. I have very sensitive eyes and was expecting to feel some pain. I regularly use anti-aging products, plus I have only used one of these sheet masks so far, so I don't notice any difference to my skin, but I would definitely add this to my beauty routine.<br /><br />*I purchased these masks at a reduced price for the purpose of trying out & reviewing.

       "  \"I burned my back of my hand in a couple of spots this past fall and have been using FLAWless for a short period of time to see if it helps lesson the appearance of those burns. First of all, I would say it's more of a gel than a cream. It's a tan color and is easy to rub into the skin. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness or residue. It also doesn't have much of a scent either. So far I *think* I might be seeing a little fading of my burn scars, but it's not very obvious. However, I am noticing that my freckles and age spots on the back of my hand are looking less noticeable and that's a welcome result.

       "  \"I am very happy with my Marrywindix acrylic organizer! I have limited counter space for my cosmetics and beauty products. Prior to ordering this organizer, I had all of my lipsticks & lip glosses shoved in a small drawer. Because they were over crowded, I had difficulties finding the ones that I wanted when I wanted them. Now I can easily see most of my lip products at a quick glance. The organizer is only 6 inches wide and 4 inches deep, so it doesn't take up a whole lot of counter space. The acrylic is sturdy & solid and is easy to clean. Recently I have been looking at acrylic organizers recently in my local stores and they seem to be over priced! This one is bargain!! My teenage daughter tried to claim this one from me, but since it is such a reasonable price, I will probably just go ahead & order her one, too.<br /><br />****Update - I ended up ordering another style of the Marrywindix acrylic organizer for my daughter. This one has drawers in addition to storage on top for brushes & bottles. She LOVES it! It is very well made and looks great!

       "  \"I am in my late 40's and always looking for new skin care products to help reduce the signs of aging, so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this serum at a discounted price in order to try it out, I was more than happy to do so. It is the first face serum that I have tried that has absolutely no scent or fragrance. It's a very thin consistency, like water. It took a couple of uses to figure out that I can't just pump a little bit on to my finger because it just rolls off. The absorption rate is pretty quick which I like. It's frustrating when you have to wait a few minutes for a serum to absorb into you skin so you can continue your skin care routine. I'm a busy mom & don't have a lot of time to just wait around!  I love the list of natural ingredients!!! I've only been using this for a couple of weeks. I'm not seeing any major improvements with my wrinkles and such, but I am noticing an overall improvement in the texture of my skin. I realize that it often takes longer with continued use before some improvements are noticeable. I'm enjoying it & will update my review after continued use.\",\n",
       "  \"I sleep better when I wear a sleep mask, so I use them regularly. When I was looking for a new one to replace my worn out one, I was given the opportunity to purchase this one at a discounted price so I could try it out. This is a nice, light weight sleeping mask. I've had one mask before that was super thick & padded, but it was actually more difficult to sleep with. Thicker is not always better! One side is satin and the side that is against your eyes is a soft, velour type fabric. The straps are a nice, thick elastic band which is adjustable with Velcro. I've purchased many sleeping masks which have a thin elastic band that is not adjustable at all. Those eventually get stretched out before the rest of the mask is worn out. This mask does a pretty good job of blocking the majority of the light. A little light can get through the area of the mask around the nose. I don't use ear plugs very often, but it's nice to have them handy when I do need them, so I don't have to fumble around my night stand looking for them.\",\n",
       "  \"First of all, this is a generous amount of rosehip oil! I've been using it daily for about 2 weeks and I've barely put a dent in it. I've been using it on a burn scar that I have on my arm. The pump lid is easy to use & dispenses a nice amount of oil. One pump is enough for my scar. When I first used it, I was a little concerned, because it comes out a golden color, but when you rub it in, the color completely disappears. It does not leave my hands feeling greasy, which is very important to me. I've been keeping it on my nightstand and applying it at bedtime. If it left my hands feeling sticky or greasy, I would have to get up & wash them. There is a very light, natural scent - it kind of reminds me of a mild olive oil. It's only noticeable when I hold my arm right under my nose. My scar is beginning to diminish. It's still there, but it has faded a little bit. I'm excited to see what happens after more use! The skin around my scar is super soft.  I may start using this to moisturize this winter.\",\n",

Also, when using or storing it, remember that it‚Äôs highly flammable, and should NOT be used or stored near fire, flames, or heat.  (See my photo of the bottle label, with all the warnings.)<br /><br />The big 16-oz. bottle is equivalent to two of the regular-size bottles (e.g., [[ASIN:B004X8IFEI Sally Hansen Nail Polish Remover]]) that you find at local grocery and drug stores.',\n",
       "  'This PHILIPS SONICARE ESSENCE+ TOOTHBRUSH & AIRFLOSS ELECTRIC FLOSSER (Value Bundle) is the real deal.  The sonic toothbrush gets your teeth cleaner than a manual toothbrush, because of the vibrating brush head and the 2-minute timer that tells you when you‚Äôve brushed long enough.  A nice feature is that the color on the brush head bristles fades to let you know that the brush head is worn out and needs replacing.<br /><br />The electric flosser works really well--maybe not quite as well as string floss, but it‚Äôs definitely better than poking into gaps between teeth with a toothpick on a handle.  The flosser is good for cleaning under my bridge, which needs to be kept really clean to prevent gum irritation and swelling.',\n",

The way this is supposed to work is to retract the bristles with the button and the hair that remains on top can be slid off.

When used where joints open and close, such as a knee or elbow, the wrap may bunch up in the crease as expected.

The fragrance of the bombs and soap is hardly noticeable. It has a whisper of rose aroma and I detect no lavender at all. I did try the letter M bomb in a hand bath and it dissolved in 5 minutes in lukewarm water and a nice foam of suds lasted about 10 minutes. The results initially felt moisturizing because my hands felt a little oily after the hand bath; however, eventually I needed to moisturize my hands with lotion.<br /><br />With regard to the dried petals, one has to like something like that in their bath because it requires straining the water so that they don't go down the drain. For me, I would never use petals in a bath, so keep the recipient in mind when ordering this.<br /><br />The bar of soap is the only item that would be used by most people.<br /><br />One thing I love is that the color of the dissolved bomb did not adhere to my skin, my hand bath, or my towel.

I personally would prefer not to have to use that hole.<br /><br />I held my mouth almost totally closed during use and tried all three modes. I did not have splash back, which was very nice. Splash back is usually typical of almost any type of water flosser so to some extent I was surprised. This flosser does work to dislodge most debris between teeth but not everything because it is not super powerful but is powerful enough. I am also impressed that the manual is relatively well written; kudos to the manufacturer on this. Normally, I feel as if I am reading Pig Latin when I receive products from China or other countries.<br /><br />In summary, my biggest disappointment with this unit is the attached reservoir that prevents me from drying this out easily.',\n",
       "  'I purchased these type sponges before and I find them great to work with. I like to use the flat end to blend and the pointed end to highlight around the eyes or cheeks. I do find liquid foundation sink in a bit so I use these mostly with creams and some powders. Overall, these are just as good as the sponges from several other vendors I have tried in the past and these are competitively priced at the current price of $10.99 for four. I also love the four color variety.',\n",
       "  'I wish I could wear these colors but most of them are too deeply hued for my fair complexion. I tried several of the colors and many make my eyes look swollen and puffy as if I had an eye infection. If I had olive or brown skin, I think these colors would look awesome. The only colors I was able to wear in this pallet are the pearl, volcano, bronze, sunset, 24k, and ash. I absolutely love the shimmer on many of these. I like that the \"compact pallet holder\" has a magnetic closure. Eye applicators have to be purchased separately.  Despite this, I think $7.88 is a great price for this selection. The colors that I did apply stayed put all day.<br /><br />The 15 colors starting from top row left to right and working down are:<br />- copper<br />- cinnamond<br />- pearl<br />- golden<br />- bronze<br />- volcano<br />- sunset<br />- pumpkin<br />- 24k<br />- moch<br />- fleshy<br />- mermaid<br />- rose<br />- ash<br />- ginger',\n",

There is a tiny instruction pamphlet included.<br /><br />The flat iron feels good in my hands. I like that the cord swivels at the base so that it does not tangle.<br /><br />This did an okay job on my hair. I have fine medium length hair and this mostly relaxed my curls so that my hair was more wavy that fully flat. I set the temperature to 300 for fine hair. I also tried 350.<br /><br />There are several things that make this iron just okay for me. First, it is weird to have the temperature controls between the flat iron blades. There is a constant temperature key and also temperature plus and minus keys, in case the constant temperature key is not set.<br /><br />The power button should be pressed to start setting the temperature and then when the LCD stops flashing, it has reached that temperature. Then the power button has to be pressed again so that the light in the middle of the plate lights up.<br /><br />The plates have some space between them and they are offset a bit from each other which is the biggest annoyance to me. I guess this is why it straightened my hair only so much. This is not a bad flat iron but it is not perfect either.',\n",
       "  \"I am sorry I ordered this bag and am very disappointed. It's cheap, flimsy, and holds light items. Items have a tendency of tilting outward in the pockets depending on the size of the item and are at risk of falling out. The detachable clear plastic tote at the bottom is a nice touch, but that is about it. The zippers are sticky.<br /><br />In my opinion this cosmetic / travel organizer will not last at all. My biggest complaint is the hook for hanging. It is not a full-size hanger hook so there are a limited number of places to hang this. It can be hung on a wire shelf with holes (like a shower caddy or closet with wire inserts) but it does not hang on a shower rod or on a closet rod or any rod much thicker than a finger.<br /><br />This cosmetic bag is not even worth consideration in my opinion.\",\n",

       "  \"After moistening my face and the brush heads with water, I tested the sensitive and normal heads with both soap and [[ASIN:B01648QDS4 L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Cream Cleanser, 5 Fluid Ounce]] and the massaging head with water alone. After a one-minute &#34;application&#34; with any one of the brushes, I love how smooth and clean this makes my face feel.<br /><br />The packages includes:<br /><br />- three brush heads (sensitive, normal, and massage) and their covers which have air vents to hasten drying<br />- one charging base with power cord<br />- one brush wand that operates at 3 speed levels<br />- one white plastic zippered travel case<br />- one instruction pamphlet<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- The wand contains a rechargeable battery that last for 30 uses. The first charge takes up to six hours.  It also has a 30 minute fast-charge feature that will provide 4-5 uses. By the way, I love the charging light on the base; it has a &#34;cool&#34; factor to it.<br /><br />- There's a one minute timer that has what I call a &#34;tripacer&#34; (like Sonicare's quadpacer) timer built in for each of the three zones of the face. These zones are the T zone, left side, and right side. What this means is that the unit pauses ever so slightly ever twenty seconds to let the user know when it's time to move on to the next zone so that the cleaning time can be distributed evenly among zones.<br /><br />- None of the three brushes were rough or extremely abrasive. The rotating and vibrating brush heads were as gentle as could be and I have sensitive skin.<br /><br />- The wand with brush can be used in the shower as long as it's not fully submerged in water.<br /><br />- This can be used to remove cosmetics.<br /><br />- The unit comes with a 2-year limited warranty.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Although these brushes remove make-up effectively, I personally only like to use this on the days I do not wear makeup. The reason is that the eye area has to be avoided. I use eye makeup so I wind up washing my entire face with my hands instead as it does not make sense to me to use a brush on only part of my face.<br /><br />- There are a lot of don'ts in the manual like don't submerge in water, don't use around the eyes, don't use if you are taking steroid-based medication, don't operate outdoors or where there are aerosol products or oxygen being administered, etc.<br /><br />- If used daily at no more than the maximum two times per day, the brush heads need to be replaced  every three months. The Massaging head (since it doesn't not have bristles) can be replaced every six months. This can get expensive. I contacted the company for the replacement price and they said they would let me know when it's orderable on Amazon. I will update the comments section of this review with that information when I receive it.<br /><br />- The battery on this unit is NOT replaceable as per the email from them which I posted in the comments section of this review.<br /><br />At first I questioned why would I need such a facial cleansing tool. After using this, however, I realized that I love how it makes my face feel so clean and smooth. This is not a tool I would use more than twice per week since I really hate using this to remove makeup, however, it's so gentle on my skin that I look forward to the cleansing action, mildly exfoliating properties, and the light massage it provides me all without the use of a chemical masque.\",\n",

       "  \"This was a lifesaver for our son with an acne issue! Being a 17yr. old boy who was feeling the high school inferiority angst at a time in life thats rough enough.. bc duh, it‚Äôs High School!! He hoped for a solution to improve his condition and give a boost to his confidence. We ended at a dermatologist who gave us a regiment of:<br />1. wipe the counter clean of all gimmicks/products<br />2. use a dye/scent free soap and water x2 daily<br />3. follow up with clindamycin 1% to dab on larger<br />  trouble spots ONLY..!!<br />So, on our way to where we wanted to go... improvement was ours in leaps and bounds. Then, Covid... Then, the mask mandate!! Soon after we developed a sort of acne/rash on bridge of nose and around mouth 2‚Äù due to synthetic material where the mask touches the face. Dr. said mask was compromising the skins ability to breathe and would subside after mandate lifted. Only, attending school x5 days a week 100% fully masked- didn't give skin any reprieve and with no end in sight, I went seeking help for acne irritation.<br /><br />As of now, we‚Äôre on the 25th day of Geologie‚Äôs 30 day regiment and I am so grateful we found this product. TBH, I personally didn't realize the extent of red, blotchy and puffiness this irritation had brought his poor skin.. until after using approx. 5 days- when we noticed a decrease in the puffy/red that had gradually appeared. Over the last 2wks- it has been clearing things up a little at a time and things seem less inflamed and aggravated. What I‚Äôm most impressed with- this hasn‚Äôt caused excess breakout like many other products in the past had done and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs bc, of the compound. Nor, has it left skin overly dry.. and both of these are huge!! I‚Äôm not even sure how it does it, maybe it‚Äôs witchcraft?! For comparison: a BFF uses Proactiv (as seen on TV!) with her 2 son‚Äôs for past x3 months and I‚Äôm actually surprised the results we had seem similar but, in a lot less time!?<br /><br />The 2 bottles of product are easily identified and instructions are simple easy and straightforward- x1 AM/PM. I applaud the packaging as it doesn‚Äôt have a feminine vibe, nothing ‚Äúfu-fu-‚Äú to turn teen boys away from using ‚Äúgirl stuff!‚Äù Trust me, I‚Äôve gone this route before- and it does matter to some! This is a non offensive clean smell and the product itself dissipates/absorbs into the skin easily after application. A few suggestions I have: leave out on bathroom counter to remind one to use daily, use fresh pillowcase every few days to keep any excess bacteria away, wash mask daily if poss. while this mandate applies.. and most of all- keep your hands away! Easier for adults- harder for teens.<br /><br />As with any product there are many factors to it success.. and for obvious reasons. I can‚Äôt promise it will cure all issues but, I feel confident in saying you can expect improvement (if not extinct..) end results. I‚Äôm so happy to have found this and will be looking into the entire product line for future maintenance use. Sorry so long winded.. I wanted to include details for any in a similar situation- I am hoping this info. may be helpful to someone else in need.. Be safe.\",\n",
       "  'So, for a man who thinks his looks strike a resemblance to that of Anderson Cooper.. (bc, of the devilishly handsome silver fox short crew cut) mixed with a longer (3/4‚Äù) faux-hawk frontal vibe.. this is a great product to work with this style as it complements the cut really well! As one who‚Äôs always used hair gel (daily x30+ yrs!) it‚Äôs hard to find one we have not tried. Bold Men casual- sold just under $20 for 3.3oz. Is a higher price point so, the expectations were high and happy to say, this came through impressively.<br /><br />This gel has an ability to last thru the day without becoming razor sharp quills nor, a crusty-crumbly flake after a full day of wear in tear. Being one who prefers a touchable hold (the hardest combo to find btw!!) this gives that to you.. We found, unlike cheaper store bought brands- less is more! (too much will weigh down the hair) **A trick of the trade for any who want to accomplish short spikes- use less product!!<br /><br />Best results came from using no more than  a nickel size amount onto towel (50%) dried hair.. and finger combing into place. The hold stays movably put.. performing better then ever expected- yay!! TBH, this may take getting used too.. IF, you‚Äôre norm is the ‚Äúfrozen gel look!‚Äù Hack: one can finger style hair into place with this- then, use blow dryer on a lower setting for just a moment.. it will expedite the setting process- giving specific direction to the final look. (A convertible would do the same but.. not sure It‚Äôs feasible in winter ha ha!)<br /><br />Product is thick yet, offers just enough slip to give you pliability to style before it settles. Note: color is clear‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just the container that is black! After hair is set, this absorbs vs. shellacs to the hair- letting hair have movement and touchable texture.. The scent is nice with a masculine appeal And after 3wks. of daily application we‚Äôve used approx. a tad over 1/4 of content (to give you an idea how long it will last..) thus far, washing daily we‚Äôve noticed no unwanted build up.. which is also a big deal- as this can lead to flakes/Dandruff..!! A good shampoo scrub removes product easily enough.. and paired with daily conditioner, it‚Äôs not over-drying to the hair. Making the $ seem worth all the quality benefits.<br /><br />This is a top quality higher end product that best fits those who have a moveable set style they like their hair to maintain throughout the day.. this can achieve the desired look and look fantastic- and does so, without all the unwanted side effects that can come with daily use of hair gel.. I hope this info can help your decision‚Ä¶ Feel free to let me know!',\n",

This product delivered!!<br /><br />After noticing a few dry spots on baby skin, I did some research on how to re-capture moisture necessary.. my concern was a bit of cradle cap and the use of Emelia‚Äôs baby bath oil on the scalp.

This mask is the best for hydration. It can be used by all skin types. The sheet is soft and flexible. You can stretch it as needed. I always stretch the eye holes since I have larger eyes. It also prevents the serum from dripping in your eyes. Another tip is to rub the mask on the backs of your hands before throwing it away. That skin needs special care also.

       "  'I have for years dealt with dry, cracked heels, and I have tried a number of things to correct the issue. While my heels haven‚Äôt hurt or anything, they have been ugly. In a search for solutions, I found this foot scrubber and decided it was likely going to work better for me than a foot rasp, and I ordered it. It‚Äôs a great tool and it works well, though I do offer some caution for those who haven‚Äôt worked with a foot scrubber or rasp in the past.<br /><br />This is an odd-looking instrument, vaguely similar to a comma in shape. The scraping side somewhat resembles a mirror with a patterned rough edge. It feels a lot like an emery board though it has more of a ‚Äúbite‚Äù to the surface, if that makes sense. The overall size and shape make it easy to grip and hold, even when wet.<br /><br />The first time I used it, I scraped away a fairly large amount of dead skin, to the point that I had feeling in parts of my heels where I have had no feeling for quite some time. It left my heels soft, pink and looking much better. However, I did discover that one can overdo, and I had nicked myself on each heel in one or two places, just enough to require blotting but not enough to really be a concern (it was less serious than a cut while shaving).<br /><br />I discovered the following day what happens when you remove too much dead skin and don‚Äôt put enough lotion on an area that deals with weight and stress ‚Äì my heels split in a couple of places and I ended up having difficulty walking without pain for a couple of days. I had put high-quality lotion on my heels, but apparently not enough. That was entirely my mistake, and it was a painful one.<br /><br />After that finally healed up, I tried again. I have fallen into a daily routine where I gently scrub my heels for a couple of minutes each, then apply lotion. My heels now look much better, they‚Äôre not splitting when I put weight on them, and I have avoided nicking myself. At least in my case this is not a tool that gets used intensely every couple of weeks, but rather it is a daily tool that gets used very gently.<br /><br />I got curious and put this tool under a digital microscope to see what the rough surface looked like. The roughness resembles a series of crescents, not dissimilar to a rasp, but much more fine.<br /><br />This thing really works and it does a good job. It‚Äôs slightly more expensive than the average foot rasp but it seems to work well. I do recommend using some caution when working with this instrument as it is possible to overdo if not careful, which is probably very true of any tool of this type.',\n",

Acne scars, burn scars, and post-surgical scars all benefit from the consistent application of this painless product, and I love that it‚Äôs a viable alternative to topically applied creams and gels. I love that the flexible material comes rolled up like tape, and I appreciate that it can be cut and trimmed into custom shapes and sizes. The chosen flesh tone would likely suit many users, so it at least provides a certain degree of modest skin camouflage.<br /><br />The silicone component brightens, hydrates, moisturizes, softens, and repairs damaged skin, so repeated use truly does seem to make a noticeable difference. Scars slowly start to fade as the skin regeneration process kicks into high gear, and these sheets are actually reusable, washable, flexible, breathable, and easy to apply!',\n",

The gold hardware on this dual-ended roller seems reliably attached, and both ends roll freely, but the larger end does seem to have a small issue that causes it to bump with each revolution, preventing the rolling motion from being completely smooth and silent. That being said, it still adequately applies smooth and even pressure to the face with each systematic use!<br /><br />The gua sha scraper exhibits some scattered scuffs and scrapes, and the edges and ‚Äúv‚Äù angle have some rough, white areas they don‚Äôt look perfectly polished, but all natural stones have imperfections to some degree. This set comes attractively packaged, and it seems to be affordably priced, so it might be a great choice for consumers looking for a starter facial set!',\n",

Regardless, I think all of the patterns are vivid and cute, so I‚Äôd gladly recommend these boho hair accessories to others!',\n",

       "  'I can honestly say that this was the first time I‚Äôve ever applied a sheet mask to my behind, but I‚Äôm always up for testing out new and inventive skincare items! Each product pouch contains plenty of hydrating essence, and each of the two included sheet masks folds out to make a quarter moon shape. It is definitely a bit challenging to try and place them by yourself, since it requires trying to twist your body around to see a mirror, but they‚Äôd be super easy to ‚Äúseat‚Äù properly if you had an extra hand.<br /><br />I will say that they do cling fairly well, and the essence feels nourishing, but the sheets ripple quickly with minor motions or movement. If you‚Äôre standing when you place them and then lie down on your stomach, they shift around and lose some of their clinging magnetism, causing little ridges and ripples in the cloth that are no longer in firm contact with the skin. Upon removal, the remaining liquid essence does easily absorb, so I didn‚Äôt experience any post-use stickiness or unpleasant residue, but I‚Äôm not entirely convinced the panthenol is a wonder ingredient.<br /><br />I‚Äôm sure the amino acid solution does firm, tone, and moisturize the skin to a certain degree, but it‚Äôs hard to really ascertain that after just one application, and since each pouch contains just one pair of treatment sheets, more of them would be required to determine if any noticeable benefits accumulated over time. Overall, I think this is an intriguing novelty item that many consumers might find humorous, so for that reason alone, I think it‚Äôs worth giving these a try!',\n",

I will say that these hair coils are slightly larger than several others I‚Äôve tried, so they don‚Äôt seem to be as tight and stretchy as the ones I‚Äôm generally used to, but they do make a nice ‚Äúring‚Äù design for the card, and the iridescent shade of purple is really attractive. Since they all come squashed together in a plastic bag with a slide zipper, they do move around and bend a lot. Because of that, 3 of the 7 decorative backing cards I received had obvious crinkles and bends across one bottom corner. They did flatten back out for the most part, but I still wish I‚Äôd received an entire set of pristine cards that were undamaged.

It fits comfortably over my hand, and it‚Äôs simple enough to grip and hold and air dry after each use. It can be used alone with warm water, but I‚Äôve used it in combination with several body scrubs and it further works to enhance the gritty benefits of all of my exfoliating sugar and salt concoctions. I‚Äôd recommend this natural glove for all skin types, and it can be used in conjunction with bath OR shower time. I‚Äôd realistically pay $12-$15 for it, but I‚Äôm pleased with its overall performance!',\n",

It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized the next morning, and it has even helped diminish the appearance of minor blemishes over time.

Each of the pouches has a small twist-off cap and the liquid contents are clear (and seem to have a high water content). The spread solution initially dries a little stickier than I‚Äôd prefer it to (stickier than a well-absorbed moisturizing lotion would), but the eventual result feels hydrating overall. Due to the compact size and flattened shape, these pouches would be great for travel. Especially after a day at the beach!',\n",

I do like that they come in 2 different shapes, and I like that they‚Äôre super lightweight and easily portable. The satin coverings are soft and smooth, and the light beige hue is an acceptable shade that would complement several skin tones. I will say that the paper backings don‚Äôt peel off smoothly every time, and the fabric has a slight tendency to wrinkle and ripple, so the covers don‚Äôt stay completely flat throughout the entire duration of wear. The rippled texture is still somewhat visible under t-shirts, the edges are slightly detectable, and I think I‚Äôd have to layer two of them together to really ensure full coverage. I‚Äôve had no adverse reactions to the adhesive component, they peel off easily, and I even wore a pair while sweating in the summer heat in Texas, and they stayed firmly in place.\",\n",

Each pair comes individually packaged, making this collected group of beauty accessories excellent swag-bag additions or party favor gifts! The included serum feels incredibly hydrating and smells absolutely divine. I‚Äôve used several different brands of similar eye masks, and these are noticeably thicker and more substantial than every other pair I‚Äôve tried! Even at room temperature, they instantly provide a cooling sensation when applied to the face. They adhere well to skin, but due to their weight and size, they do have a slight tendency to slip downward with gravity. For that reason, I suggest lying flat or reclining while wearing them, so that they stay as close to the lower lash line as possible. Each package still contains some extra serum after the eye masks are removed, so I massage that residual liquid onto my neck for added moisture potential. The combination of hyaluronic acid, collagen, and 24k nanogold particles leaves my under eye area feeling incredibly hydrated and refreshed. Consistent use of this product helps combat fine lines, puffiness, and dark circles over time, so I‚Äôm thrilled the whole set is so affordable! I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with this product.',\n",

The rollers move silently, as promised, and they don‚Äôt seem to rust or wear out in any way. The stones are cool to the touch at room temperature, but placing them in the refrigerator (before use) ensures an ultra-chilled experience. I love that the magnetic box lid has instructions printed on the underneath side, and the soft, drawstring pouch is an added bonus! The set even comes with a informational mineral card that provides reassuring details about the quartz pieces featured. Each tool is perfectly nestled within in its own compartmentalized cutout, and the rollers definitely seem to help increase circulation and boost overall skin radiance! This would definitely make a perfect gift set for someone!',\n",

I'm so happy I ordered it.<br /><br />A nice, thin line of the wash dispenses from the tube.  (The tube is very sturdy and durable, for those interested in packaging) Now, the wash starts out like a kind of lotion but it lathers quickly and easily into a light, whipped foam. ( A dime size amount is all I need to sufficiently cover my face/forehead.  ) The whipped foam is SO creamy and it just feels so darn good as I apply it and when its on my face.  IDK if its possible but I swear I can feel it cleaning, hydrating and moisturizing my skin pretty much immediately.  After I rinse with lukewarm water and pat my skin dry with a towel, my skin is soft, smooth, clean and has  a bit of a glow.  It looks and feels so good and healthy. It feels fresh.  And it feels that way long after I've used Easydew.  Easydew leaves my skin feeling like it did when I was younger-before I used makeup, before I spent too much time in the sun unprotected.  It feels revived and I just love that feeling!  Everything about this daily wash is perfect in my book.  It works great and makes my skin look/feel great. The ingredients and what they do for skin is impressive. (I recommend taking a minute to read the info above regarding the ingredients!)  The scent is wonderful (though it vanishes VERY quickly).  And I have no issues using it on my dry, very sensitive skin.  The price is more than reasonable, especially with the results the wash brings and the fact only a small amount is needed when I wash my face.  Easydew is officially  a part of my daily skin care  routine now.  I absolutely recommend Easydew!\",\n",
       "  \"I am finding SO many uses for Shiny Leaf's coconut and sweet almond oil! I do have some experience with coconut oil but this is my first time using sweet almond oil.  Thanks the labels on the bottles, reviews and internet searches, I'm finding SO many ways to use these oils...sometimes together, sometimes individually.<br /><br />Because I have terribly dry, sensitive skin, my main goal was to see how one or both oils could help protect my skin, especially now that winter has arrived and my skin is REALLY taking a beating.  Both oils work well to hydrate and moisturize, so I mixed a few ounces of each in a mist bottle. After I bathe, I mist  a combo of the oils over my skin to help hydrate and moisturize. The oils absorb quickly and do not leave an oily/greasy look OR feel to my skin.  I'm already seeing a decrease in my dry skin/itchy red patches of skin. I experience NO discomfort whatsoever when misting these oils onto my sensitive skin.  Both oils also work wonders on hair by moisturizing, hydrating, improving hair texture/strength, stimulate hair growth /thicken hair, and nourish the scalp to prevent dry, itchy flakes. In addition to using my combo of oils after bathing, I also give my hair a spray or two with the mister and sure enough, I'm seeing less hair in the drain and on my hairbrush after brushing. My hair is soft, smooth and shiny WITHOUT looking or feeling oily/greasy from the oil combo.<br /><br />I use the coconut oil (alone) to help remove makeup, under and around my eyes to soften and reduce fine lines, I rub a small amount into my scalp (as does my husband) to help stimulate hair growth, on the kid's faces after their baths to soften (especially in cold weather!), on my nail beds every couple of days and a light amount on any patches of eczema/red skin.  (It relieves the itching/burning and redness from eczema quickly!)<br /><br />I use the sweet almond oil (alone) on  dark circles under my eyes, a SMALL amount on split ends in my hair, a drop on chapped lips, I'm just starting to tinker with it for aromatherapy purposes.  I recently learned that it can help fade scars so I've begun to rub some sweet almond oil into a scar on my finger to see what happens. If it helps, I'll then move on to a small facial scar I have. I'm also trying something on my own; just started doing this a few days ago.  I get nosebleeds every single day, at least once a day, throughout the winter when the heat is on in the house. This started when I was 2 years old, I'm now 49 so I've experienced this my entire life.  I now rub a small amount of sweet almond oil under my nostrils before bed.  Since starting this, I continue to have nosebleeds. Yesterday, I had only one and it involved just a few drops of blood. I didn't whip through numerous tissues like normal.  ONE tissue took care of it. (that's huge for me!) I have NO clue if its just a coincidence or if the sweet almond oil is helping in any way but I'm going to continue using it.<br /><br />These oils are phenomenal! Both bottles are 16oz.  I love the fact that they have normal caps on them but pumps for each bottle are included as well.  The liquid of each is thinner oil than I expected, which I prefer.  Both absorb quickly. Neither has a scent.  I've found SO many uses for these oils, I can't wait to discover more. ( I'm SO happy with these oils, I recently purchased Shiny Leaf's biotin hair conditioner and cannot wait to try it! ) I find the price to be incredibly reasonable, especially since you're getting TWO bottles of oils! HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />*FYI...the mist bottle on the end in my photo is NOT included! I used one of my  own mist bottles to combine both oils.  You will get both bottles AND pumps that you see in my photo, NOT the mist sprayer!\",\n",
       "  \"The directions on the tube of FRESHME's mud mask (pelargonium graveolens) state  those with sensitive skin should use the mud mask once a week. Because I have  sensitive skin that's precisely what  I did.  I also followed the directions that state the mask should be used after bathing or after warming the skin with a towel for 5 minutes.  Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive because I really didn't notice much of a  difference after using this mud mask.  Its on the light, watery side so its easy to apply and doesn't take much to cover my face.  In the 15 minutes it sits on my skin (10-15 recommended per directions) it never entirely dries and I don't experience the feeling of skin tightening at all.  After I rinse it off (it rinses without issue), my skin feels clean but a bit dry. I cannot detect any change to my pores.  This just isn't the mud mask for me. I've discontinued using it and will be giving the rest to my niece over the holidays.

FRLEDM's 24K gold under eyes patches help tackle both issues and do so quickly. I keep the patches in the fridge-I get better results when they're cold and it feels good as well.  I wear the patches in the morning for about 15 minutes and I'm good to go.  It did take multiple uses before the results were obvious but that's to be expected.  I like many of the ingredients in the patches, including: collagen, hyaluronic acid (HUGE fan!), and aloe, to name a few.  I'm not a  fan of the roller, unfortunately.  I just do not care for the way it feels on skin...its not smooth and gentle, more like tugging and pulling.  I will be passing it along to my mom who is anxious to try it.<br /><br />While I'm not a fan of the roller, I am a fan of the patches and am pleased with the results they provide.  I will continue to use the patches and definitely recommend them. I hate to say that I don't recommend the roller just because I don't like the way it feels so I will just say  its not for me.\",\n",

He's not yet noticed a reduction to his fine lines though he hasn't been using the lotion very long but he is pleased with the job its doing to help moisturize his skin.  His skin isn't nearly as dry as it had been so he is experiencing some much needed relief.

       "  \"I ordered LA LA Leaf Guayaquil hemp lotion for my husband . While it is indeed a hands and body lotion, it targets especially dry skin areas-elbows, feet and heels. He has unbelievably dry , rough elbows and does so year round. He's always rubbing creams and lotions into his elbows with very little positive results. Until now. LA LA Leaf is softening his terribly dry, cracked elbows and doing so each time  he applies it. He has pretty much stopped complaining about his dry elbows, instead expressing  (nearly EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!) his excitement now that he has finally found a remedy.  lol.  While I ordered LA LA Leaf for him, I've now started to use it on my hands as well. Its lightweight, absorbs quickly and doesn't cause my skin to look or feel oily or greasy. Let me tell you, the hemp oil, rose flower water white bark extract , aloe (a fave of mine) ingredients do a heck of a job softening and smoothing my hands after I apply LA LA Leaf. I'm already planning on using extra LA LA Leaf in the winter when my hands get the dreaded deep, extremely painful cracks due to cold weather. I noticed in the info provided above, this lotion can be used after spending time in the sun. Because my skin is so terribly sensitive and dry, I do believe I will use LA LA Leaf after spending time outside in the sun when the weather gets warmer. Regardless of where you use LA LA Leaf on your body, its going to leave you with soft, smooth skin and will do so quickly.  I do believe LA LA Leaf is worth the cost. It doesn't take much lotion to cover the skin (in the areas we are using it on) so this tube is going to last us a decent amount of time. I have every intention of continuing to use/buy LA LA Leaf. It's wonderful\",\n",
       "  'If you\\'re a dog owner, its practically guaranteed at some point, you will have to deal with your dog having dirty, muddy paws. Happens often with our bichon Mac. (Naturally, it recently happened right after I cleaned and mopped the house! lol)  I ordered the Mr. Ros automatic cleaner for small/medium dogs. Its very sturdy and durable, not at all flimsy.  Its roughly 8\"tall  and has a removable mat with silicone bristles in the interior which is easily removable for cleaning purposes.  The bristles are very soft and not at all hard or sharp. It arrived already charged. A USB cord is included. To operate, simply add water to the washer-(2-3 cups per instructions) Liquid soap may be added as well. (I didn\\'t use soap) Turn the washer on-it does make noise though its  not terribly loud at all-and place the dog\\'s paw in the washer for 1-2 minutes. Dry each paw with a towel after cleaning. Mac wasn\\'t thrilled throughout the cleaning process but he also wasn\\'t really scared by it. My husband started to pour out the dirty water before I could stop him so you won\\'t see much,  but you can see in my photo the water is discolored a bit following the cleaning.  If a wet towel isn\\'t enough to clean Mac\\'s muddy/dirty paws, my regular cleaning method is to put some lukewarm water in a small bowl , dunk each paw one at a time and use my hand to remove the dirt from his fur while submerged. Quite honestly, I really don\\'t see much of a difference between that cleaning method and the Dr. Ros paw washer. Perhaps results vary depending on the breed of dog but for our bichon, I really don\\'t see a  difference.',\n",
       "  \"You know the saying 'kill two birds with one stone'? That is precisely what I had in mind when I ordered Follain Mattifying Moisturizer.  I have dry, sensitive skin but its not oily. My husband has oily skin. I have fine lines and wrinkles on my face. My husband does not.  Because Follain moisturizer promises to combat oily skin, as well as fine lines and wrinkles and is a clean, vegan product, I ordered it to find out if it could help the both of us with our skin issues.  I'm happy to tell you that it has helped the both of us.  The moisturizer is a bit thinner than I'm used to. I don't say that in a bad way because its not at all bad.  One pump of the canister delivers enough moisturizer to cover my facial skin. Its very lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving a look or feel of oily/greasy skin. It provides immediate hydration and does a nice job of softening my skin. I am VERY happy to say I absolutely have a noticeable reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face. They don't go away entirely, but there is a definite reduction in size and appearance. ( I can't tell you how much I needed to experience this right now as my 49th bday is this week...that means 5-0 isn't far behind and I'm kind of starting to freak about it! )  My husband also tried this for his oily skin with impressive results.  Follain controls his oily skin and prevents the shiny, damp look that comes with oily skin thanks to the mattifying benefit of this moisturizer.  We both use it as needed and not even on a daily basis.  Follain works and it works well. We're both very pleased and grateful for the results!\",\n",

The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work.  Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks).  I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed.  The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to the lotion. It did not cause burning/itching, etc.  When the time was up, I removed the socks and cleaned my feet.<br /><br />Here's what happened:<br /><br />Day 1 (the day after I did the treatment)-nothing<br /><br />Day 2-VERY light peeling-more like little 'threads' of skin<br /><br />Day 3-Actual peeling -I was pulling some decent pieces of skin off of both feet<br /><br />Day 4-WOW...BIG pieces of peeling skin!

Those are my trouble areas. Calluses are very thick and cracked on my heels.  (a million times worse during winter months!) I DID have some progress on my heels but nowhere near the rest of my feet.  I used the scraper (? not sure if that's what it's called) and made a bit of progress.  I wish now that i had wiped some of the lotion directly on my heels when I wore the socks.  When I do my next treatment, I will absolutely rub some lotion directly on my heels when I start.  I'm impressed and thrilled with the results.  Its flip flop season and my feet aren't always pretty to look at.  This foot peel really helped.  I absolutely recommend Monikahair foot peel if your feet are dry and cracked.

       "  'A few weeks ago, I tried a different brand of purple conditioner. This was the first time I\\'d ever used any purple conditioner on my blond hair. After using the other brand, I noticed a subtle change to the brassiness in my hair. While I was satisfied with the results, I also assumed it had done all it could do for my hair.  Tonight, I tried WELLUTION Purple Hair Mask (for blonds).  The mask is easy to apply and it distributes nice  and even on my hair. My hair is thick and shoulder length. It didn\\'t take much mask to cover all of my hair. ( I did put extra mask on my roots/scalp area because I do dye my roots) I let the mask sit on my hair for 10 minutes.  It has a nice scent to it that I very much like. I had no issues rinsing the mask from my hair. It rinsed out without issue. It did not cause my hair to look/feel oily or greasy. I was able to comb it without issue and let it air dry.  When my hair was completely dry it looked and felt nice and soft. My natural waves were present without flyaways.  But...I also noticed my hair was FAR less brassy than it had been.  The change was not subtle the way it was with the first brand I\\'d tried weeks ago.  This was very noticeable. To say that I\"m pleased with this mask is an understatement. Its wonderful.  And I WILL continue to use it as needed.  Blonds, if you\\'re dealing with brassy hair, give this mask a try.

       "  \"Crest Whitestrips are one of the most popular among the store brand tooth whitening products. They were introduced to the public in 2001 and they have been satisfying customers ever since. They work by concentrating special whitening ingredients like peroxide directly against the teeth where they can penetrate the surface for a full thirty minutes. Repeated usage for fourteen days should result in significantly whiter teeth.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips claim that these strips can be worn and used any time and that, once in place, you can go on with your normal daily routine for 30 minutes while the strips have the opportunity to work. It is true that you can do what you want, but there are certain activities that are not easy to do with one of these strips in place. I'm one of those people who has a tendency to want to move my tongue around when a have some type of dental object against my teeth and more than once, I have accidentally pushed the strips out of place. The gel helps to hold them in place but they can still be moved with little effort. Also, if you start talking with a Whitestrip in place there is a chance that some of your words will come out a little funny- like someone who has had a little too much to drink. I have found that, for best results, I try to do nothing at all when wearing Crest Whitestrips. The best thing to do is read a book. The time goes by quickly and it makes it easy to forget the strips are in place.<br /><br />Waiting for fourteen days is frustrating and it is possible that you may need a second treatment after the first, depending on how well you stick to your 30 minute per day schedule and how well the Whitestrips stayed in place. But the results should make you happy. At first I avoided Crest Whitestips because of the price and because of the product itself. Spreading liquid gel on the teeth seemed much simpler than having to wear an object against one's teeth. I didn't like the idea of hassling with strips so I avoided buying Crest Whitestrips and tried the liquid variety in its various forms first. I finally gave in and purchased Crest Whitestrips because I got tired of waiting for satisfactory results. And I did get good results with these strips. I followed the advice on the package and used the upper strips twice per day first, then the lower strips twice per day for the next seven days. This is a good idea because you can compare the shade of the top teeth with the bottom, right after the upper treatment is completed. I could see a significant difference as all those years of soda pop, coffee, tea, and other staining drinks were suddenly washed away.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips use the same chemicals that dentist's use to clean and whiten teeth, so they are safe if used as directed. They are designed to keep teeth white for six months after each fourteen day period of usage. They also come with a money back guarantee. In order to get the guarantee. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can get a full refund of the purchase price provided you have followed the correct procedure for a refund.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips work well, but like other over the counter whitening products, they only work on natural tooth enamel. They will not whiten dentures, caps, crowns, or other artificial dental material. If you have teeth with artificial surfaces that are badly stained, you will need to seek the help of a dentist or other professional to get rid of the problem.<br /><br />Crest Whitestrips are a little more expensive than the liquid whitening formulas but Crest Whitestrips are also more effective. I am satisfied with Crest Whitestrips and I recommend buying a box for effective treatment of discolored teeth. They are not as thorough as the treatment provided by a dentist but all things considered, these strips are a good buy. They eliminate stains and return your teeth to a more youthful appearance in only two weeks if used as directed.\",\n",

       "  'At first sight, this razor may cause some consternation to Transformers fans, who can\\'t be faulted for thinking that the arcitec 1090 is really the Decepticon known as \"Frenzy\" in disguise.  It stands at attention  like a little bathroom sentinel on its silver base, proudly announcing the shaving time on its shiny chest, the three circular razor heads seemingly following your every move while waiting to transform when you least expect it.<br /><br />Even when it\\'s on the move, it can remain snugly in its futuristic-looking pod, which also has charging capabilities, and looks not unlike a cryogenic holding chamber from sci-fi movies.<br /><br />From my (and my husband\\'s) experience with this razor, it would be a much better piece of equipment if it actually did something as cool as transform into something else.  Unfortunately, it\\'s not much more than a pretty face, and isn\\'t for all types of facial hair (or leg hair for that matter)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Cool looking with a sleek, modern, hi-tech style. Fits very comfortably in your hand.<br />- There\\'s a display with BIG numbers to indicate how much shaving time you have left. If you ever get caught half way through your shave with no juice, then it\\'s time to see your Optician right away.<br />- Easy and quick to charge (1 hour). The quick charge feature for a single shave is a nice feature for when you\\'re pressed for time and out of charge.<br />- Aesthetically pleasing and efficient stand with suction cups to hold it firmly to the counter top. Razor and stand look great next to your expensive bathroom faucets.<br />- There\\'s a safety lock feature to prevent it from accidentally coming on when travelling. Also useful to prevent your kids from trying to use it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It gives a reasonably close shave on coarse hair, but you have to keep going over the same spot repeatedly to achieve that. Men\\'s facial hair was okay, but the hair on the neck and chin was almost a mission impossible. (Ladies, forget trying to shave your legs with this razor.) My husband had to resort to a cheaper Norelco model to get those stubborn hairs, and the arcitec left the area under his chin and on his neck feeling irritated and sore.<br />- It took 12 minutes to shave, almost twice as long as compared to his other razor, even with the larger shaving area.<br />- The trimmer feature looked useful and functional, but proved to be in a very inconvenient position relative to the shaving heads. You\\'ll need to remove the shaving heads entirely for the trim feature to do its job, and even then, it was not very effective.<br />- Washing/cleaning after use was easy enough though it meant having to open the three individual cutting heads separately. A simple mechanism to pop all three open simultaneously would have been nice.  In addition, the area for catching hair isn\\'t very big.<br />- The travel pod is a nice bonus feature, but on the big side if space is an issue. You probably don\\'t need the travel pod anyway, since the razor comes with a safety lock.<br />- Very expensive, and not as efficient as cheaper models.<br /><br />Norelco did recommend in the manual that you should use it for three weeks without using any other razor so that your skin would adjust to the razor, but at this price, I\\'m afraid I\\'ll need instant gratification.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, December 17, 2007',\n",

It's a creamy concoction and it takes very little to cover my entire face - the instructions say just use one pump and that is sufficient. There's a faint scent that makes me think of Asian food - I guess that's the sesame seed oil,but the scent fades quickly.

My favorite polish is by another company in a rose gold.<br /><br />The photos included for this polish clearly look rose gold. Sure, different monitors, screens, etc etc, but everything else has been spot on, EXCEPT this polish.<br /><br />First off, I love the rubberized top. It makes it so easy to handle. The polish itself flowed well and went on smoothly.<br /><br />My beef is the huge color difference. I\\'ve already opened it, I can\\'t return it. It totally looks rosy and pearlized in the photos on Amazon. BUT, in reality, it is mauve, nearly purple. The color name is \"Pinky Promise\", so the minimum I expected was a shade of pink. They should change the name to \"Purple Promise\", which would be much more accurate. It is so different, I thought maybe I was sent the wron bottle. But the sticker on the bottom has the right name. Maybe someone messed with stickers?<br /><br />It is not a horrible color, but not what I wanted, and very dark for me. Very disappointing. The quality is ok, but the shade is WAY off from the photo and name.<br /><br />UPDATE: Found the weakness in this polish. Despite it being so dark, I wanted to test the \"breathable\" polish, as I\\'d never tried it. I have to say that it lasted really well. I put it on with no bottom or top coat, just the polish. It was still going strong, no chips or flaking, four days later.<br />Until I did a big batch of dishes.<br />I usually wear gloves to wash dishes (yes, sadly, we have no dishwasher where we live.

I remember really liking this night cream, and so when it came up as an option to try, I thought maybe it was another version, but no it is the same. I think the change has been in the company. They were entirely a Chinese brand, and now I see USA labeling- but I think it is still a Chinese beauty product. Same stuff that I know and love. Same press down dispenser container. I am copying over my old review as the info is all the same, and my experience is the same. While I dont rate on price, I am pleased at its effectiveness and how it is half the price of similar items I have used.<br /><br />Safe, effective moisturizing product with promising ingredients. I am used to using several of these ingredients, and I must stress that it is important to use SPF when using anything with retinol. I saw that this has quite a list of ingredients that I am not totally familiar with, so I went through each one and looked them up. I included a short description of each (and included EWG rating for those that like that sort of information). You will note that most all have a very GOOD rating of 1 or 2. The only ingredient that has a higher number (bad) is for the retinol- and that is because of the degree to which retinol/vitamin A, by nature can absorb into the skin (toxicity) and how our skin is more sensitive to UV rays. So again, wear your SPF when using any retinol based products.<br /><br />--GoMay is a Chinese (turned USA) beauty company and from everything I have used, the products have been impressive in formulation and the thought and safety put into creating it.<br /><br />--Awesome, attractive container. Has a press down lid that pops out some product. Keeps it clean and safe! BUT if you want to get into the container, the lid does come off.<br /><br />--Minimal scent- naturally occurring.

       "  \"When the times comes to wash my face, this mascara comes off extra easy. I didnt realize how much other mascaras left behind, once I did my usual face wash (oil cleanse to start, then follow up with water based), and the mascara began to break down right away. Very pleased with that.<br /><br />This SkyHigh mascara is actually lengthening. I have basic lashes, and I dont expect anything magical from mascara. But this is noticeable on my lashes, and as I was swiping it on I could see the lashes looking elongated. Not clumpy (that's good or bad depending on the look you are going for). This has more natural look. I haven't noticed any flaking, definitely no smudging. My eyes are easily irritated by makeup, and this mascara doesnt seem to bother me. I can wear it on both upper and lower lashes.<br /><br />At a budget friendly price ($5 for 1, or $7 for pack of 2), it is worth trying. I would consider it again at this price. Another cheapie I really like is Essence, which has both waterproof and non waterproof options: https://www.amazon.com/essence-Princess-Effect-Mascara-Cruelty/dp/B00T0C9XRK\",\n",
       "  'An adorable shower cap that fits my large head. It says it fits up to 24\" head, and mine measures 23.5\". Then I have loads of hair- semi thick, nearly waist length. It all fits! Yet isn\\'t a big bulbous excess of material either. But I am definitely pushing max space available (again, I have a large head).<br /><br />I simply dont wash my hair every day, but I do hop in the shower. I dont notice my hair getting wet at all, but I dont put my head in the water even with this on. I have a spray nozzle for washing and rinsing, so I guess I am able to control where the water reaches better.<br /><br />The fit is surprisingly good. The rear has an elastic portion to provide a nice fit. The spacing left over once in place is reasonable for my large head and mane of hair. I really was skeptical, but am glad I went ahead and got this. I have some cute shower caps, but none as nice as this. The little bow on top makes me feel like I went back in time to the 50s or something. Adorbs!<br /><br />I dont use it for keeping my hair out of face for make up or skin care, but it would certainly do well for that too. Also, if I had pool.. while it isnt a pool cap, if I just wanted something to help keep excess water off my hair while casually wading in a pool, this very well could work for that too.',\n",
       "  \"Primer, liquid Foundation, BB cushion, and a flat kabuki brush. I have another Phoera kit, and I like it a lot.<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B093GFPFP9<br /><br />I am not sure if Nude (#102) is the lightest shade they have or not, but if you are like me and have fair skin with cool undertones this may lean a little warm. It isn't bad, but if they had a better match available I would want to get that.<br />THEY DO!! this is for fair with pink undertones<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RZ6QZLJ/<br /><br />The BB cushion is a tad lighter, and a better match for my skin. I do like both. I tend to like cushion over liquid, but both of these are fantastic. I really like how these feel, and despite being a  little warm on my cool skin, the make up looks good on the skin. Doesn't settle into every nook and cranny, nor dry flakes.<br />My skin is 40+ so this is something I look for in make up.<br /><br />The primer is fantastic. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. Use less than you think you need lest you want a more oily look to seep through. I find that primers like this are great for dry skin, and for more dry feeling foundations.. but their foundations arent drying. So less is more with their primer.<br /><br />The formula for the liquid foundation really impresses me. Staying power is good. Skin feels comfortable. Skin looks healthy. I can touch my skin after and it doesn't feel like there is make up on. Provides really good coverage with a little bit yet doesn't look cakey and fake. Can be built up. I would recommend this over dermablend, personally. All my redness disappears (from Type 1 Rosacea). To provide a more sheer wash, just change up your application- use a damp sponge to put it on, or use a damp sponge as last step to blend it in and lighten it up.<br /><br />I really think it is worth the try. I wasn't even going to try this, but since they provided so much information in their product description it really piqued my interest. If you need coverage with a natural look.. try this!\",\n",
       "  'Not shiny, not matte, somewhere in between. They call it semi-matte, and I agree. But anyone who has lines or parched lips, should always avoid any formulation with the word \"matte\" in it. You are better off with a lip liner and a moisturizing lip gloss or lip stick. Matte will always dry down and make the lip skin pucker a little. My lips aren\\'t wrinkled, but I can tell the formula pulls the skin together a little.<br /><br /> The color is bold. 06 Crush Berry appears to be a blue based red. Definitely red, like a classic red, just blue based rather than orange based. It feels super smooth on the lips, not at all tacky. Doesn\\'t feel or look dry to start, but it dries down to a matte look. Can achieve a decent level of stain with a few applications and blotting.<br /><br />The first pass has a more oily look and feel to it. I smash my lips one way, and it appears to come off lips a little. Then I smash them in the other direction, and the color is there again. But once it sets, it isnt budging like that again. Any color disappearance is from drinking, eating.<br /><br />The case looks and feels good. The overall product is pretty good, just comes down to wanting a bold semi matte color that will perform like most other lipsticks- wears off with drinking & eating.Even then it doesnt disappear. Just might need to even out the color after awhile.  It seems to hold up to the product description. So for that (and all else), I give it a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />I\\'m not in love with it, but it looks nice in pictures. Has a bright pop of color. This is not a subdued look at all. I find that it nearly matches a bold lip tint that I like by \"I\\'m Meme\"<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091GSRN78/',\n",

The contents are in a sturdy flip top box makes it look like a gift (and was shipped in a regular box, maintaining integrity of the product box). Almost reminds me of a subscription box as the deign on the outside gives it a special look. It kinda threw me off because I nearly expected more of a generic look. I thought, ooh did someone send me something? lol. But no, I ordered this lol<br /> Once I opened the box, a colorful, glossy card stock card with the phrase, \"Happy Birthday to You\" on one side, and totally blank on the other. This sits on top of dense, well packed brown paper grass. Each product is carefully nestled underneath. The products look good and they smell good. Really good-- not cloying and cheap. Just pleasant. The entire unboxing experience was pleasant, and I would totally buy this for someone. You know how some gift compilations look cheap? This has a classy, artsy look that I would be proud to give to someone.<br /><br />This will probably be my go to gift item for anyone who enjoys these sorts of products. Set comes with lip balm, a bath bomb, a scrub, a cream, a bar of soap, and a soy candle. I\\'ll use everything. Personally, I use bath bombs in my shower as I dont take baths, or I use as a foot soak.',\n",
       "  'What doesn\\'t work for my hair, works for my cats. That is our agreement. So these are pretty much a pack of cat toys as I prefer hair bands that fit comfortably on my wrist. These have plenty of stretch, but elastic is tight when retracted. Good or bad depending on needs. So too tight for me to keep on wrist. These are ok if I keep them tucked into a drawer and I grab one as I need one. They have good snug elasticity for thinner hair. My hair is thick, but I can use them for the ends of my hair when I put my hair in a braid. I dont like them for pulling all my hair back. These won\\'t be a repurchase. They\\'re \"ok\"',\n",
       "  'This is a package of 15 individually packaged biodegradable wipes. All of their products come in 15, 30, or 45. This 15 pack at $8.95 makes them $0.59 each. Easy to open, all tucked into a flip top box<br /><br /> Excellent for on the go, for travel, for whenever. I have used a variety of Busy Co wipes, and I have liked them all, some more than others. When I selected this, I chose it after taking a look at the ingredients (how I always select items to buy or to try). So it was weird not to see direct ingredient list on this product page. I have included the ingredients here:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Hyaluronate, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Powder, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice<br /><br />This unscented GLOW formula is aimed toward those seeking to BRIGHTEN SKIN, IMPROVE DRY SKIN, and REPAIR DAMAGED SKIN.<br />Not sure who is trying to use this on babies, but this product is not marketed for that use.<br /><br />I use this on my hands and feet, prior to bed. Then I add my lotions. The wipe does a good job cleaning my skin and nails. Adds little hydration. Could use them being a little more damp, but they do work. I have a couple tucked into my purse in case I just need a wipe, but for the most part I am keeping these for night time use. While I think this product is ok, it isnt a must have for me, and I likely wont repurchase. But I do like other Busy Co products, and have found that they are a better fit for my needs (and have been repurchases).',\n",

Sometimes I do this a few times to saturate my skin. Then I follow up with other products (serum, moisturizer, and/or sunscreen). Ceramides help build and maintain a healthy skin barrier. Hyaluronic acid attracts moisture (but be sure to lock it in with a moisturizer or an occlusive ingredient). Sedum provides intense hydration & minerals, and vitamins to the skin. So lots of good stuff going on with this toner.',\n",

Really nice used alone, or paired with their real ampoule drops, or with your own routine. Just slather on, allow some time to absorb before hitting the pillow.

I\\'m impressed.<br /><br />I haven\\'t had skin procedures, but this seems like a go-to item if I were to ever have something done- whether it be professional dermabrasion, laser, basically anything that leaves skin a little raw and exposed for a few days and would benefit from a more healing like cream.<br /><br />the drops: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X4FDWKP',\n",
       "  \"I really like this OGANA CELL Peptide Concentrating Amazing Lotion. I'm going with 5 (4.5 if I could, but leans more 5 than 4) even at early impression. Sometimes you just know.  I have been using it with their Real Ampoule Drops, which I rated a 4 at this time (4.5 if I could. ) as I need more time with it. However, this lotion has been easier to determine because it instantly lends a dewy, supple, perfectly moisturized skin that lasts all day and night (or night and day in my case as I have been using it at night). Anything else it is a doing for me is a bonus, and I know will take time, but right now the instant effect is lovely feeling, radiant skin.<br /><br /> It is a thin, light lotion but it is rich. I love how it feels, and how good my skin looks come morning. Little goes a long way. Maybe it is a combo of this and the drops (which instant absorb, and works well with this lotion). No matter, I am pleased with my experience with Organa Cell products so far. SO much so that I have been looking into other products. I am a big fan of K-beauty, and will likely buy their sunscreen soon.<br /><br />Now, I have no idea what the full ingredient list. I will double check the packaging to see if it is there. I went to their website (Korean, so you will need a web translator) and they do not have the full ingredient  list shown (unless I missed it). Pretty much what you see on this product page is what you will see on their actual web page. I sniffed around other merchant pages (jolse,wantitall,koreanbeautybox, etc). but just found the same info.<br /><br />Real Ampoule Drops: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X4FDWKP<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, dry, CLEAR (no acne), smooth, but contend with Type 1 Rosacea (redness, visible veins, no bumps). ALL that I have tried by Organa Cell has been gentle, no discernable scent, absorbs well, and feels good on the skin. Great for sensitive skin as it has components to help protect, build, maintain skin barrier.<br /><br />I dont rate based on price, we all have our own budgets. Organa Cell is pricier than most K-beauty I try, but it is still a brand I would recommend. I would like to see a full ingredient list, but I also find that it doesn't stop me from using their products and considering other purchases. Take my money, haha<br /><br />If I experience anything else worth sharing, I will be back to do so.\",\n",

What is this sorcery?<br /><br />If I experience anything else while wearing these, I will come back to update. My initial and immediate impression was just so favorable that I had to jump on a review to say so.<br /><br />Currently $3.99 for a set of two. Good deal',\n",
       "  'It works! Comes down to preference. I use dry shampoo often. I prefer the powder over the spray. I find they work better and for a longer period of time over the spray. Sprays tend to work quicker, so if you are not used to powder variety, know that you have to give it some time. So apply this, let it sit on hair for a bit before combing through. Then comb through and maybe add more. Go finish getting dressed or whatever, then finish combing hair and finishing off your style. OR apply some before bed and wake up to fresh hair.<br /><br />It doesn\\'t take much. I have used other brands with similarly small containers, and the stuff lasts forever even with frequent use. This is a little smaller at 1.5 ounces, which they state is travel size-- but it will still provide many applications. At $9.99, I think the price is great (even though I do not rate on price)- and I will likely buy this again but in the dark hair option (more about that in a moment).  This is a nozzle tip dispenser. Squeeze bottle to get it to disperse. Be sure to take the protective seal off from inside the cap. Mine was stuck up in the cap. It took me a few humorous attempts to get the product out from nozzle before I realized that the safety seal was caught up inside. Once I got through that snafu, all was good to go.<br /><br />I failed to see that this is for \"light hair\". It is a pale yellow powder. \"This particular shampoo is optimized for light hair, so if your hair is blonde, red, or strawberry blonde, this ‚Äòpoo is for you\". Not all dry shampoo makes the distinction, but some do. So if/when I purchase the dark hair option (which they have, and I will link below), I imagine it will be a darker powder. But it really doesn\\'t matter!!!  Many of the dry shampoo powders are white, so I figured this would be the same in terms of overall look. If not too much is used, and if it is brushed out well enough rarely is there any noticeable haze. Again, I am used to working with the powder form so it comes easy to me to get it to work.<br /><br />My hair was freshened up as expected. A light lift. Not a massive amount of volume, though over course of day I noticed it seemed more full (I have very long hair, so the roots will be weighed down a bit at first). No problems. I like it. So far the product comes out from the nozzle well.<br /><br />DARK HAIR option: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084JCXT18<br /><br />PS.  dry shampoo can often be used as a body powder too.

Give your shampoo bottle a good shake. 2. Part your hair into several segments. 3. Hold your shampoo bottle about six inches away from your head.

       "  \"My skin is dry, totally clear (no acne) save for some redness & visible veins from Type 1 rosacea. This sunscreen feels quite gentle and does not seem to irritate my skin at all. It adds a light but effective level of hydration without feeling heavy. It is a chemical sunscreen, so zero white cast. It is thin, and goes on like a light lotion. Typical viscosity among my other K-beauty brands.<br /><br />I have a wide assortment of sunscreen, of various formulations and types. It is my #1 skin care product as I use it daily all year long. It is a habit. I avoid the sun for a few reasons, so sunscreen is vital to my well being. I live in a variable climate (from dry, freezing temps to humid hot) and I have sunscreen preference depending on season and situation. I tend to prefer mineral (my fair skin can handle any white cast) but do utilize chemical sunscreen often.<br /><br />I am going to like this for basic daily summer use. I tend to reduce my morning skin care routine down to a basic wash or splash of water and a moisturizing sunscreen. Since this offers SPF 50 (P++++), I know my skin is going to be pretty well protected. Since it feels like a moisturizer and goes on clear, I can skip my other skin care if I want. I tend to skip morning skin care in the summer because I am likely to just sweat it off anyway (I have a more involved night time routine to make up for it). So a sunscreen such as this is easy to use, makes my skin feel good, and easy to reapply throughout the day. I dont wear make up usually, but for sake of review I used it under a light foundation tint. Seems to play well- I didnt notice any rolling/pilling. I'll use it up. I have also used it over other skin care (hydrating toner, serum, light moisturizer) and it worked well on top of all that too.<br /><br />Not sure yet if it will be repurchase.

Know that this is meant to clump! Not supposed to have lather or creaminess. I had looked at the ingredients and some of the description and I suspected a gommage. The directions on box say to use on wet face and that it will lather. It doesn\\'t. There is some clumps, but not as much as if it were used on a dry face, which is what is expected from a gommage. We want glorious clumps! For best results use on a clean dry face, not a wet face. I have tried it both ways, definitely use on dry face. Works but not as good on wet face.<br /><br />So use a generous amount. Just pat it in all over. Let it sit a moment, then massage it in in gentle circular motion. As you do so, small clumps will form. This is a combination of product and grime and dead skin cells. Basically, a \"gommage\" is like an eraser on a pencil, and your skin is paper. The graphite marks are dirt and dead skin cells. The product once applied is like that eraser-- it is removing those \"marks\". What happens when you use an erase? You start to see balled up pieces of eraser mixed with the graphite/pencil marks. That is more or less what is happening here. Those balled up pieces are a mix of product, dirt, and cells. Rinse, and carry on with rest of your routine. It is a very gentle \"peel\". And quite effective. But less so when used on wet skin-- the ingredients just can\\'t grab the gunk on face as well. I\\'m surprised there is such a discrepancy in instructions.<br /><br />Instructions on container:<br />\"How to use:<br />Apply desired amount of peeling gel and work into a rich lather by wet hands.<br />Gently cleanse by massaging thoroughly over face in circles, avoiding eye contour.<br />Rinse off with lukewarm water.\"<br /><br />But the pictures clearly show what is expected--balled up bits/clumps.<br /><br />SO, it it may be a matter of terminology/language.

       "  \"I'm pleasantly surprised by this Almay Length & Lift mascara. My litmus test to a good mascara has been reduced to simply whether it irritates my eyes or not. As for lengthening, lifting, volumizing, etc is meaningless in comparison. This DOES NOT IRRITATE (!!) YAY!!! Also, the blackest black is wonderfully black; makes my brown eyes pop. My lashes are well coated, making them look thicker, and there is a lift that I greatly appreciate as my lashes otherwise angle downward. Length is notable too. My lashes are nomrally ho-hum. Not thick, not thin, not long, more on short side, and angle down. This mascara is pleasing me. I dont care for make up except for mascara, but I rarely find one worthwhile. THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE!<br /><br />I'm feeling so vain. I keep looking in the mirror at my new found eye lashes!! haha!!<br /><br />this product is hypoallergenic and ophthalmologist tested.<br /><br />PS. Pics are of mascara only. No other make up. I realized that this darkens my lash line enough to look like I'm wearing eyeliner. I'm not! :)\",\n",
       "  'Hopefully the bottle I received was an oversight in aging inventory. My bottle was hard to get open, and once I did I could immediately tell that the oil had oxidized. Totally unusable as it was truly rancid. The oil was thick, all cakds up around the topper, and the bulb dropper was rock hard. I was unable to squeeze it. I think the dropper had dry rotted, then that allowed air into the bottle, leading to a rancid product. It was evident not just based on looks, but also that super special aroma of a rancid oil. Too bad, as I love seed oils for use on body, face, and hair. This had to go directly into garbage. Not at all usable as something with anti-oxidants become PRO-oxidant when exposed to air. This is going to do exactly the opposite of what you want. Again, I give benefit of the doubt. I imagine it was a bad bottle and hopefully not at all what anyone should expect. Even so, I have to rate what I have.',\n",
       "  \"I've used fiber lash mascaras before- they usually have a pronounced effect, and is why I wanted to try this Kissio Derol mascara. The thing is, it doesn't do anything for me. I am perplexed. I applied the primer (comb brush with hairs/fibers), then followed up with the bushy brush mascara. And.. nothing. I can not see even a miniscule amount of added volume or length. Not even more than a basic mascara. Initially it had not bothered my sensitive eyes for the first few hours but then my eyes started getting itchy and irritated like they had something in them-- the fibers were falling off into my eyes! My eye where it was most bothered was red. I'm done with trying mascara unless it is a known brand.<br />Sad :(\",\n",
       "  'I\\'ve only just begun using this, so this is a first impression review. I am fairly familiar with the active ingredients and understand how they work (and that they do work, so I expect this to continue that). The new part is the pearl extract, which has both immediate effect and longer term use benefit. I can attest to the immediacy, and it will be with using this for greater amount of time to determine if it a repurchase or not. As I learn more, I will share more. Here is a break down of what is in it and what to expect:<br /><br />BLANCHET GLAM PEARL RADIANCE CAPSULE SERUM is a supremely light weight gel serum with hint of floral scent from lavender, geranium, rose, and sandalwood. Barely detectable.  A little goes a long way. This weightless serum adds a mild level of healthy sheen. Korean Beauty emphasizes healthy skin, hydrated skin, supple skin, dewy, glowing skin. It is never matte. So while you could cover this with your foundation or powder, KB is all about letting natural skin shine through. The gentle, mild barely there sheen provides more of a glass look than a shiny look. Subtle. As for the rest... The primary active ingredients are NIACINAMIDE (2%) and ADENOSINE (.04%).<br /><br />NIACINAMIDE is a skin care work horse. It provides a variety of benefit to all skin types, ages, and concerns. It is a water-soluble vitamin (B3) that works with the natural substances in your skin to help improve skin barrier, fix past damage, visibly minimize enlarged pores, tighten lax pores, improve uneven skin tone, soften fine lines and wrinkles, diminish dullness, and strengthen a weakened surface. As I hone in on ingredients that pack the greatest punch, niacinamide has stood out as a must have ingredient in my skin care routine. I especially like it for its ability to brighten pigmentation. It also is one of few ingredients that work well with other ingredients without concern for contraindication or nullification. Skin care can get tricky, and this ingredient is just so easy to work with- so go ahead and use it with retinol, peptides, acids, etc. Niacinamide simply helps skin be healthy and look healthy and radiant. As with most skin care, it can take several weeks to several months of consistent use to see changes. This serum will help over time, but other ingredients provide an instant radiant glow.<br /><br />ADENOSINE is a rising star in anti aging products. There are studies that demonstrate that adenosine is an effective ingredient for improving the appearance of wrinkles, in both the eye and mouth area. Interestingly, adenosine directly affects the production of type I and type III collagen in the skin by binding to A2A receptors in fibroblast cells. So if it can help boost (or at least maintain) collagen, and help collagen from breaking down (collagen is what keeps our skin plump. Compare your 45 year old face to your 18 year old face, if your face now looks \"thinner\" despite no losing weight, it is the decrease of collagen that has produced that look). Since adenosine has been shown to stimulate the production of collagen, applying it topically can help to prevent (and somewhat even reverse) wrinkles. *thumbs up*<br /><br />80% FERMENTED PEARL EXTRACT is rich in amino acids and trace minerals that are highly moisturizing, soothing, and brightening. I must say, this is something that is new to me. Before this product, I had no idea that there was a use for pearl extract. It is used in topical skin care products as well as for use internally. I really dont know much about any of this, but a cursory search led me to a few interesting bullet points:<br />-Increases skin\\'s collagen production<br />-Helps repair skin\\'s damaged cells<br />-Lightens skin\\'s tone and improves blemishes<br />-Diminishes fine lines and wrinkles<br />-Controls oil and shine<br />-Reduces pores and promotes smoother skin<br />-It has soft hues which shift subtly from direct to side views<br /><br />PURPOSE<br />Skin Brightening<br />Anti wrinkle<br /><br />Uses<br />High-intensity brightening lotion with 80% of fermented pearl extract in capsule technology<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />ACTIVE:Niacinamide,Adenosine<br />INACTIVE: water, dipropylene,  Glycol,1,2-Hexanediol,Agar,Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer,Synthetic Fluorphlogopite,Titanium Dioxide(CI 77891),Polyglyceryl-10Laurate,Polyglyceryl-10Stearate, Ethylhexylglycerin,Hydrolyzed Pearl,Ocimum Basilicum (Basil) Oil, Elettaria Cardamomum Seed Oil,Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil,Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Flower Oil,Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil,Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Rosa Damascena Flower Oil,Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil,Glycerin,Propanediol Hydroxyacetophenone,1,2-Hexanediol ,Centella Asiatica Extract,Butylene Glycol,Propanediol ,Portulaca Oleracea Extract,1,2-Hexanediol Centella Asiatica Extract,1,2-Hexanediol ,Panax Ginseng Leaf/Stem Extract Moringa Oleifera Leaf Extract,1,2-Hexanediol , Hydrolyzed corn starch Beta vulgaris (Beet) Root Extract,Glycerin,Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glutathione,Plankton extract,Disodium EDTA,Tromethamine Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer,Xanthan Gum',\n",
       "  \"This review is for the foot wipes only. I was intrigued as I do foot masks once a month, and I am always otherwise giving my feet attention every night. Sometimes I take a wash cloth to them, so these wipes are rather convenient when I am sitting in bed ready to lotion up but didnt take a wash cloth to them yet. These are quicker, easier, and nicer feeling than a wet rag. These aren't all that wet but I managed to wipe down both feet effectively enough. 14 wipes, individually wrapped. Suggested that only one wipe per foot.. so seven uses from this box.<br /><br /> The individual packets are convenient but wasteful if not using them on the go. I dont know how much benefit they offer beyond a basic wipe down. Non irritating, non drying. Not loving them enough to be a repurchase.\",\n",
       "  'I like the shampoo and conditioner a lot- leaves my hair soft, manageable, and healthy looking. I added in this serum as I hoped to gain hair density or at least reduce loss (or reduce cycle frequency and/or duration). I dont have trouble growing my hair, I have trouble keeping it. So my hair is long, but much less dense than previous years. I transitioned from minoxidil to this. I wont do that again, as any gains I got from minoxidil were lost-- and I do contribute some of that to not using this as consistently as I did that. I\\'ll explain what went into that below. This serum helped the condition of my hair and scalp, so I think it works well with minoxidil instead of in lieu of it. I likely wont continue with the serum for a few reasons.<br /><br />1. there was no instruction as to how to use this product. It is a dropper bottle, and I pretty much just used it like I did with minoxidil-- massaged whatever I pulled with dropper and distributed all over scalp, primarily at crown. Was this the correct way to do it? no idea. *<br /><br />2. It does say to apply to clean hair. Well, many of us do not wash our hair every single day. I have long curly hair that leans dry and there is no need to wash it daily. So I am either applying this to unwashed scalp daily or it only gets applied a few times a week.  Hence the lack of consistency. So right here it eliminates some would-be users if it has to be on a fresh washed scalp.<br /><br />3. the dropper is uncomfortable. I do not want to drop it from the dropper. I want to run it across the scalp so as to keep it from getting on my hair. The dropper is a little sharp feeling (at least my bottle that I received). I like the dropper style, and my thought is that if I were to buy this again, I would use a dropper from an old minoxidil bottle instead.<br /><br />4. How long should this bottle last? Since I had no idea how much I should use, I often wondered if I used too much or too little. Any new hair treatment needs to be given 4-6 months of consistent use to see results, if any. I know the shampoo and conditioner helped, and this serum has great ingredients that will help existing hair and scalp health.. but the inconsistency on my part from lack of instructions as well as expectation of using on fresh washed hair made it impossible to see if I could get benefit from it.<br /><br /> * \"It is best applied to damp hair after showering. We recommend visually splitting your scalp into 4 sections/quadrants. Depending on the amount of hair, use around 3-5 drops per quadrant. I like to drop into fingers and work into scalp. The remaining amount on your fingers you can work through your hair. It is perfectly fine to use the serum many times a day. That being said, it is important that the scalp/hair is clean\" (--I saw this written in the community question section of this page. Including this on box or in a leaflet would have been greatly helpful)<br /><br />The ingredients are of quality, the products work well together. I have since gone back to minoxidil, and once I have stopped the current shedding phase, I may buy another bottle to use as a support product. For that, I give it 4 stars.',\n",
       "  'I first tried it on the back of my hand and was horrified. The resulting color was orange pink. Then, only because I wanted to thoroughly & accurately test the product for reviewing, I decided to put it on half of my face. I expected to see orange skin like on my hand, but oddly, this just blended into my skin as a VERY CLOSE MATCH. So I put it on the rest, including under my eyes. Not bad. Glad I put it on my face.<br /><br />My skin is fair, pale, with cool undertones. What I think happened is that my hands were much cooler than my face. It is the heat of the skin that triggers the color change. It is winter, and I keep my house cool so naturally my hands were on the cool side. Skin of my face must have been just warm enough for this to work.<br /><br />That being said, the color match is impressive. It comes out in a grayish white cream, then bursts into color, then recedes to a dang close color match. On me, it was just a tiny bit darker & warmer than I would normally go for my ultra pale face. It covered well and did a nice job of evening out my skin tone (I have pink cheeks from ROSACEA- type 1 redness w/ visible veins). It didn\\'t look weird. It goes on like a foundation, so plan to use a mirror to make sure that you are adequately covering your face.<br /><br />I think this is better for those that do not have dry skin. I have dry skin. Even with great products used underneath, I still thought this looked a little patchy on my skin in some spots. No pilling or balling though. Stayed in place for remainder of day. It could be my lack of skill in applying make up (this is an SPF, but it needs to be manipulated like a foundation).<br /><br />Overall, it isn\\'t for me, but it does seem to be a quality product. I find it to be an interesting product and might be worth the try, especially if you want some natural coverage that will even out the skin. It does cover nicely.

       "  'I fell in love with Easydew products awhile back. I do tend to use and try all sorts of products, but I have a short list of products that I really like for me. Easydew is on that list. Easydew is also a brand I trust. I just sense that it is doing what it says it is going to do. Budget friendly too. They dont use frilly words and overinflated promises. They just seem straightforward with science backed ingredients. I like that a lot. I think all or most of their products include EGF (epidermal growth factors) which I am keen on for skin repair and health.<br />I haven\\'t used an easydew product yet that I didnt like or love. This Repair Control Renewal lotion always feels so good on my skin. I love it for my simple skin days. It has so much going for it-- addresses a multitude of concerns- and is gentle. It is one of those lotions that just make the skin look and feel good immediately. If you have dry skin, their toner is pretty great too.<br /><br />My skin: 40 something, dry skin. Clear (no acne, minimal lines) but with type 1 Rosacea (redness & visible veins/telangiectasias).<br /><br />My typical routine:<br />morning: wash face, apply hydrating toner (sometimes use 7 skins method), serum, moisturizer, SPF (I ALWAYS use SPF, that is my #1 skin care product)<br />night: double cleanse (1st oil based wash, then water based wash), hydrating toner (often 7 skins method), serum/actives, moisturizer and/or moisturizing overnight \"mask\" or occlusive.',\n",

I\\'ve been a fan for awhile now, so I was stoked to try this face wash. I use other Easydew products with success.<br /><br />My 40 something dry skin benefits from the gentle, hydrating cleansing. It has some creamy lather, kinda foamy, feels nice to massage in, and rinses clean. Skin feels good. Not taut.<br /><br />Dont need much. First couple of times I squeezed out what I was used to using with some other cleansers. This is thick, and once you add in a little warm water it takes off with lather. If you end up not loving it for your face, it would make for a fabulous shaving cream and/or body wash. This tube will last a long while no matter what you use it for.<br /><br />I use a two step cleansing process most nights of the week. So that means starting off with an oil cleanser to help dissolve stubborn grime and products (primarily my SPF, but make up too), then using a gentle water based cleanser to actually wash away was was broken up and left behind. Some nights I can get away with just a water based cleanser. Mornings I use just water based cleansers. So really I can use this any time.',\n",
       "  \"Interesting product! I have used another rose tinted sunscreen before and was intrigued enough by it to try another. This one might be even better. Let me tell you about it in terms of my ROSACEA (type 1: redness, and visible veins/telangiectasias). I would not thinking adding MORE PINK would be at all helpful to my already rosy complexion. But it does a phenomenal job evening out my skin tone.  I have fair, cool toned skin so I find this is still a tad dark-- so if you have skin that is even a little darker than very pale, then this should blend in real well. Yet even with the clearly pink mask that it gives me, it looks better than pink and red splotches. I just wouldnt go out in public with this alone. SO, this got me thinking about using it as a BASE layer to another sunscreen, mixing it, or the best use.. using it under make up. It will provide a great foundational canvas for a layer of foundation. Wont need to rely on the make up to even things out. If you have splotchiness, you may like trying this out. That's what appeals greatest to me-- that it evens out my skin tone gently.<br /><br />Nice smell, even coverage.. makes my skin feel really good. Semi dewy supple feel. My skin is DRY, and this feels good on, Maybe it just plays well with my other skin care products? Oddly.. it has a slight gritty feel while putting it on. Yet doesnt have a gritty feel ON the skin.

       "  \"I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!), and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft, smooth, clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F), dry day. Super moisturizing.<br /><br />Oddly, I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps, and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches, nausea), but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners), I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass, but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil, orange oil, and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean, but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.<br /><br />I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent, and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich, super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did, I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here, lol. I kinda want it as a body wash.

I follow this up with a moisturizing SPF (their sunscreens are great) or a moisturizer if using at night.<br /><br />I dont think it is bad. I really just think it is ok. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. For me it isn't quite a 4 star product, so I am going with the middle of the road rating of 3. Your experience will vary. I think it would be especially appealing to those who prefer a weightless non tacky Centella Asiatica product. While I have zero issues with this, I am not likely to repurchase it. I have preferred products, especially for EGFs. However, if I notice anything else-- good or bad, I will be sure to update. It can take at least 2 weeks for a product to show its effectiveness, and it can take that long for the skin to acclimate to a new product. I am a little early on writing this, but my skin is used to centella asiatica as well as EGFs, and with some Isntree products.\",\n",
       "  \"My tin is dented.  It just arrived in a warehouse mailing bag. There was no protective tape, tamper sticker, or cover, or product box... so I am not sure what this product has been through before arriving to me. Ew. I know products are sold by weight not volume, but the container really does look like it is missing a portion, as it is half empty. It is probably all there. The container looks to be a 2 ounce capacity, with 1.7 ounces of product. The product is dense, so after settling, I imagine this is accurate. But still.. between the dented can and the lack of protective seal, I am reticent to use in on my face, and definitely won't be buying it as a gift (which I was considering as I ordered this for me, and figured if i liked it then I would buy it as part of a pampering gift).<br /><br />Too bad because the container otherwise is attractive, the product smells good, and the ingredients are interesting; highly nourishing & repairing for the skin. I love self care products, and doing an occasional mask is relaxing.<br /><br />1.7 ounces has 3.4 tablespoons. Probably use half a table spoon to cover face. So maybe 7-8 full face applications? I guess price it out like a sheet mask. $3.75 per treatment if assuming 8 applications. More or less depending on how much you use.<br /><br />I hope the company considers adding a seal or tamper sticker.\",\n",

       "  'The bottle and texture is very much like a hair mousse or shaving cream, but is a wash for the body.  Instead of a pump or squeeze bottle, this comes out though as pressure aerosol - also just like a mousse or shaving cream.  The ingredients necessary to make this happen are Butane and Propane. They are aerosol propellents.  If you have ever used mousse, hair spray, various perfumes/body sprays, air fresheners, aerosol deodorants, or shaving cream,etc..  then you are already familiar with these ingredients. They are generally recognized as safe, and are used in small, diluted quantities in skin care. Fun fact, \"These ingredients are used in cosmetics and personal care products as a replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC propellants, some of which have been shown to have negative effects on the environment\".  I\\'m not a big fan of slathering my body with butane, propane, or isobutane, but I understand their use in this type of medium. So it\\'s up to you to decide.<br /><br />This company does have non aerosol body wash available too..<br /><br />The resulting foamy wash comes out thick, it is creamy. Because it reminds me so much of a shaving cream, that it what I have been using it for. Then whatever is left over I use on rest of body. Is pleasant smelling enough to me but it isn\\'t quite a pure aromatherapy experience for me. Clearly it uses a variety of essential oils- rosemary, orange, eucalyptus, peppermint, limonene. However, for whatever reason, it contains \"parfum (fragrance)\" as an added ingredient. As well as Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, another synthetic fragrance ingredient. Is there not enough naturally occurring scent from the use of essential oils? I think the added synthetic fragrance is redundant and takes away from the olfactory experience.<br /><br />As an actual wash, it is fine.<br />3 stars-- this is just a middle of the road rating.  I am not in love.  The experience is underwhelming. I am much too quickly going through the container. Aromatherapy experience is a little off  as I pick up on something other than essential oils.

Might even be perfect post skin treatment sessions that may leave skin feeling irritated.<br /><br />Stocking stuffer!! I love how budget friendly this pack is. I love making little self-care packages to hand out, and while I will buy and use masks in the $5-35 range, I prefer the $1-3 masks for the token give away (think: facial mask, hand cream, lip balm, etc.. tiny cheap self care packages). I also prefer the cheapies only because I am not sure if the recipient will definitely use it, and the higher end masks tend to be more discerning in what it attends to. The more basic masks tend to be good for nearly everyone, and the resulting feeling is at least a fresh, hydrated face.

I like how it feels when I first put it on, and I like how my skin looks and feels come morning after having put it on the night before.<br /><br />I like it for day time or night time use.

While I prefer a heavier cream at night, this is instantly moisturizing enough that I don\\'t need to add anything else on top. Perhaps once the extra dry cold weather comes in, then I will add something on top. However, when paired with their hydra toner, it may be enough no matter the humidity.<br /><br />It has a light fragrance (has fragrance as an added ingredient, for those who refrain). Not great but not bad. Fortunately it is light and doesn\\'t linger.<br /><br />Any alcohols used in this are fatty acid alcohols and are highly beneficial to the skin, especially dry skin.<br /><br />Using medical grade EGF,  it contains 10ppm of EGF, which means that it contains the maximum amount of EGF allowed for a cosmetic product to give you maximum results.',\n",

       "  'This Juicy Chemistry face & body scrub is a very mild, and seemingly gentle \"scrub\" chock full of great ingredients. For rating, I am right in the middle of neither really liking it nor really disliking it (ok, maybe leaning a more toward dislike for me). The \"3 stars\" include the fact the company (and their ingredient selections) seems of high quality and may be worthwhile to check out.<br /><br />I have mixed thoughts on this, so please bear with me as I try to explain.<br /><br />At first glance, the small container is packed to the brim with a dark brown, dry, granular looking substance. This is primarily a combo of coffee powder and cocoa powder. I thought it was going to be a rough scrub, and immediately thought that there is no way I would use that on my face. Since it says, \"for face AND body\" my plan changed  to use it on my body in the shower. However, the directions say to apply TO FACE, and allow to sit for 10 minutes/until dry. That isn\\'t happening as a body scrub. In the shower.<br /><br />So now I am back to trying it on my face. It did not come with a spatula or spoon, so plan to use your own. Or scoop out with a finger.I have tried it by spooning out a bit of product and adding water, adding a hydrosol, and adding an oil. The latter makes it easiest to use through I do not know if it impeded the other ingredients. Also, it wouldn\\'t dry with oil. But it did stay in place with oil.<br /><br />Any granular feeling quickly melted down, so I felt better about using it on my face. But still, not a fan of anything granular on face. Overall, I don\\'t like it for my face- I only tried it once because that is all I could handle. . It felt like it left some powder behind. I felt compelled to rewash my face to get any remnants off. Meh.<br /><br />Body is fine (and is why I selected it for use). When used with all bases I mentioned, the result was a slightly oily feel. Not heavy, not greasy. Definitely a little bit of hydration/moisture. Ultimately not a fan of it for my face, but do like it enough for use on body. HOWEVER, I do not \"keep it on until it dries\" while I am using it.. in the shower. I just use it like a regular body scrub. I either add water to it, or oil. OR use a basic creamy body wash as the vehicle. Now that I think of it, even a body lotion would work (especially if you have one you dont love and want to use up). Once again, the oil (or body wash/ lotion) is easier to worth- I can work it all over body, massage it in, and as it rinses away once again that slightly oily feel is left behind (not greasy, not heavy, rather soft and light; rather nice).  Make sure to rinse shower as this will splatter brown all over.<br /><br />I like that the product is packed into a small jar container, and that it needs a base (water, hydrosol, etc) which can be good or bad depending on your preference. By needing to add your own, the product is more concentrated (not paying for added water,etc), but it lends just a tiny bit of inconvenience. Use in the shower is awkward. Use as a scrub mask is going to come down to preference. If you like a more granular feeling physical scrub/exfoliator this may not be for you. If you use more, you may get more of a scrub feel (I guess you could add sugar). I use less as I do not want a harsh physical scrub. For the shower, I prefer a greater scrub feel, so I use more. I am thinking now I may add this to another jar, add some cream or oil, and some added sugar for an easier to use shower scrub experience.<br /><br />Packaging is nice, and pleasant to look at.

Vitamin E also helps with collagen synthesis and reduce the appearance of scars.<br /><br />High Vitamin C content in Orange makes skin radiant and also helps in collagen production resulting in supple, hydrated and age-less skin.<br /><br />Sugar acts as a natural exfoliator and helps to gently remove dead skin and impurities making it radiant and softer.<br /><br />Rich in fatty acids and natural vitamins, Shea Butter moisturizes the skin to relieve dryness.

So for me, I find that it is almost TOO light for my needs. Here is what I do like: I like that I can easily pair it with other products as it doesn\\'t seem to pill or roll.  I would never use this at night as it is just too light for me, but it has been fine for use in my morning skin care routine- after a serum and before a moisturizing SPF. I don\\'t feel like it works as my only moisturizer, but I DO think it is worth a try. The ingredients are fabulous.  While it doesn\\'t feel like it is drying, it doesn\\'t give me that dewy oomph that my preferred products can provide. Maybe I need to use it for a longer duration (sometimes that happens.. something I use for awhile doesnt seem to be doing anything but I keep using it to use it up, and at some point I notice a noted improvement).<br /><br />Despite it containing a lot of different nourishing oils, I would prefer it to feel and look a little oilier. Maybe over time? I am thinking this might be good for dehydrated oily skin, or normal to lightly dry skin. I am just guessing.<br /><br />I would use it to hold in other hydrating products like a thin mask. Or MAYBE on days when I just want something on and I don\\'t want to fuss.<br /><br />Unexpectedly great for hands. Immediate softness. The backs of my hands feel super wonderful after applying this. The pump container makes it easy to dole out on the go. Would be great for keeping in a purse.<br /><br />Since it is thin but rich as well as the ease of application makes it REALLY nice as a neck and chest cream. If this formula is supposed to increase skin oil over time, then having that added advantage applied to the neck (naturally not oil area) could be a game changer for those concerned with skin on the neck.<br /><br />I think it is lovely, overall. 4 stars',\n",

I highly recommend that it is paired with their Double Hydra Toner, especially if you like using hydrating toners using the 7 skins method (apply toner in layers until skin has soaked up as much as it can). Then follow with this, and the skin feels light, fresh, hydrated, supple, smooth, plump, and oh so happy. I find that I can use it day and/or night. I really have no preference.

These two are my go-to items. If I don't feel like playing around with other products, or if I am in between testing products, this combo just saves my skin and makes it look and feel so good. In a time when we really shouldn't be touching our faces (and we shouldn't anyway), sometimes I can't help it as my skin just feels soft and pleasantly moist.<br /><br />The bottle style is very familiar to me. Tall, thin, with twist off cap. Squeeze to get product. 2.02 fl ounces will last quite some time even when using a generous amount. Dont forget neck and chest :)<br /><br />When I say I have semi sensitive, I used to have really sensitive skin- felt easily irritated, often had a burning feeling or itchy feeling. I had to learn about ingredients and figure out what bothered me. But ultimately, I learned that it incorporating ingredients that help repair and maintain the skin barrier is what helps most of all. So ceramides, occlusives, Natural Moisturizing Factors (NMF), Serine, copper, and several others.. that just help the skin significantly. Add in hydrating toners and consistent use of SPF, and the skin is looking good. Now, using harsh products can contribute to broken skin barrier, but often it is simply environmental or physical (too many exfoliating sessions, too harsh/physical scrubbing, too much sun/wind/vacillating temps). So I consider my skin semi sensitive because I am aware that I used to have really sensitive skin and now I seem to not to, but I still actively regard and address my skin in terms of maintaining skin barrier. THIS product has ingredients that help the skin barrier (NMF, Serine).<br /><br />I like it a lot, good stuff. Definitely recommend.\",\n",

This makes the first benchmark accurate. \"After 3 weeks of using Seanergix 4 New Hair it will be visible that the hair is in process of reduction in hair falling\". Possible that I was ending a shedding phase, but I have indeed experienced reduced shedding while taking this product.<br /><br />It is because of this that I decided to KEEP GOING with it. Going forward.. For me to be able to tell the second benchmark has been met, \"After 3 months.. almost 40% of new/regrowth.. will be seen\" I will need to continue to buy this.  So I know I will actually need at least 2 more to be able to tell if this second benchmark is accurate. I may be awhile, but I will continue to update. (and of course, if it does actually work, then I will be continuing this for quite some time).',\n",
       "  'The \"Drop the Bomb\" BBOSONG Suns stick uses one of THEE best UVA/UVB sunscreen ingredients on the planet: \"Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine\"! Say that 5 times fast. Or once. lol. It is a broad spectrum, highly photo stable, chemical sunscreen. Chemical sunscreens mean that they absorb rays and disperse as heat before they can reach skin and do damage. The SPF rating of 50+ and PA++++ means that it offers the highest amount of protection that a sunscreen can offer.<br /><br />Korean skin care, particularly sunscreens, can use super effective ingredients that products made in (or for) USA can not have because the governing bodies have not approved it. It is not because they are unsafe, but because there is a significant amount of bureaucracy involved. No new sunscreen ingredients have been approved in the USA in over 15 years, sad since there are so many wonderful innovations in the rest of the world. We lag greatly behind. Fortunately, we can still buy these products.<br /><br />The other sunscreen used in this product is, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Octinoxate)- a less stellar chemical sunscreen that has mixed thoughts on its efficacy, safety, and desirability. It protects only against UVB rays and breaks down when exposed to light (10% per 30-40 minutes). However, when combined with another broad spectrum sunscreen, it compliments it very well.<br /><br />The third sunscreen component is, Octocrylene.  Screens out the UVB and somewhat in the UVA II range. It is quite photostable (loses 10% of SPF protection in 95 mins) and is often used to stabilize other photo-unstable UV-filters (octinoxate) It is also often used to improve the water resistance of the products.<br /><br />As for all the other ingredients- primarily stabilizers, viscosity controlling ingredients, hardeners-- basically all ingredients that make it a STICK than can glide onto the skin. It is formulated to melt into the skin on contact, and yet absorb thoroughly. Basically, you won\\'t even know it is there.<br /><br />And like so many other Korean skin care items, there are ingredients that go above and beyond the basic sunscreen-- included are skin loving ingredients (emollients, skin conditioners, soothers) such as Japanese knotweed, water lily, gotu kola (centella asiatica), camellia japonica, Lespedeza Capitata Extract (anti inflammatory), scutellaria (ie scullcap/mint), green tea, licorice, rosemary, chamomile<br /><br />Has a super mild scent- clean, fresh almost like a deodorant, but subtle.<br /><br />Happens to be a in a container that reminds me of deodorant. Super small, cute. Stick in a pocket or purse. I happen to love using it on my hands. I am in my 40s, and while I have been using SPF most of my life on my face, I figured it was high time to remember to put some on my hands. I like keeping this in my purse or my car, and applying it when I go to drive. That seems to be the time that my hands are most consistently exposed to the sun. Figure, hands on the steering wheel and in front of a big window. So yeh, this is perfect for that.<br /><br />I have no problem using this on my face.  Doesn\\'t grab skin when used over a moisturizer. If need be can be applied/emulsified in palms then patted on. I prefer it as my \"reapply\" SPF rather than my first application product (I am used to a cream style). When I do apply it to my face, I always run it over my lips. It is very silky, doesnt have a sunscreen flavor or feel, and it is adding much needed hydration and protection from the sun.<br /><br /> Again, I am in my 40s.. clear fair skin but with Rosacea (non acne- just redness and visible veins). Leans dry. Loves Korean skin care.<br /><br />This is so clear, so clean feeling, and so incredibly light that I wish I could show you how it doesn\\'t even feel like anything is on. Not greasy, not even dewy. My skin feels bare.<br /><br />If I have any complaints, it is the use of fragrance. While it smells nice and doesn\\'t really linger.. it would not make a top choice for use on my face. I do however like it for everywhere else and rather enjoy the light scent before it dissipates fully.<br /><br />Even so, it is a really good product, so far. If I experience anything else, I will be back to say so.<br /><br />For all the other ingredients, the each rate 1-2 (very low in terms of hazard to self or environment) on EWG Skin Deep Database.',\n",
       "  \"First one I have ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to. When I looked at it, I thought I had been bamboozled as it appears to just be an airy dry foam sponge in a tin can. Maybe that is all it is. So I set out to change eye shadow colors, and was floored by how it thoroughly cleaned my brush. What is this sorcery? I don't use too many colors, and I either change brushes or wipe it on a reusable cotton round to clean off one shadow before moving onto next. My brushes always still have a little color on them (whether it be powder or cream). THIS? This took it all off my brush.<br /><br />I still stare at my clean brush in wonderment.<br /><br />Are there better eye shadow switching pans? no idea. I can only tell you that my brushes always come clean, so far.<br /><br />Also, fits nicely in my make up box!\",\n",
       "  'I may be in the minority here, but I rather like this mascara. And yes, it is made in China. Not, \"made for USA but made in China\", but it is a Chinese beauty product. No idea if its been around, how it ranks with beauties on that side of the world. Couldn\\'t tell you the ingredients. Tried translating, but I repeatedly failed. Search engines insisted that I was looking for CPAP not CPCP.<br /><br />So, I usually end up with more mascara that I DONT like rather than what I DO like. I LIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why?  Because my eyes are super sensitive to make up, and this doesn\\'t bother me. AT ALL. I love mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after a couple of hours (if not immediately, depending on the brand). No joke. It sucks.  So when I encounter a mascara that..well.. allows me to actually wear it- I add to my list of potential repurchase. I have tried so many over the years. Funny thing, a few on my list happen to be cheap mascara (Essie, Wet-n\\' Wild,), --but not all-- and most mid level priced brands bother me as well as uber expensive \"natural, healthy\" brands. What I have noticed is that the WATERPROOF brands do the best in terms of feeling gentle and non irritating (probably less likely to flake). Next up, is the most recent generation of mascara that includes \"4D silk fiber lashes\", which this is.<br /><br />The 4D Silk Fiber Mascara is so very different in feel and performance over traditional mascara. It has this interesting ability to coat the lashes- like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash. It easily and instantly really darkens the lashes, and can add volume and length. The formulas tend to be waterproof, and yet somehow wash off much much much easier than typical waterproof formulas. So for me, from application through face washing, the 4 D silk mascara is much easier and gentler to work with.<br /><br />My lashes do not look like how they have it portrayed in the pics. If you already have long lashes, I imagine this will be extra glamorous on you. For me, with my mediocre lashes that simply need a boost of color to make me happy (and not make me want to claw my eyes out)- this works well on me. I included several pics. 3 with one eye with it on, one eye with it off. Then I followed up with 3 pics of the mascara on both.<br /><br />It shouldn\\'t matter, but the box is super pretty. I still have it, and I have no use for it, but it is just so pretty to look at. Added a picture of the mascara wand.<br /><br />If I can glean any further information about this product, I will come back and add to this review.',\n",
       "  \"Can't go wrong with Cica cream, and at this price it is a bargain.<br /><br />Cica cream is soothing and hydrating and is especially great if you have easily irritated or sensitive skin. It can really be used by anyone with any type of skin, or skin conditions. It is just a good all around cream. It typically contains centella asiatica, the star of the soothing ingredients. Not sure how much is in this, but it states 50% of the product<br /><br />It is even nice to use this when you just want to give your skin a break from other products, or if your skin has been stressed (environmentally), or if your skin is reacting to something and you need a soothing cream to get through until your skin settles down.<br /><br />I usually use it on my face (in winter) or hands all year, but especially lately. While I always wash my hands often, the past few months I have been using commercial anti bacterial soaps which are much more drying than some-- using CICA cream helps keep my hands looking and feeling healthy). SO yeh, I am mostly loving it as a post hand washing cream.<br /><br />Before this one from Village11Factory, there were two other cica products I have used in my life, both a bit pricier. So I think this is good one to try if you are seeking to try it out, and want a simple but effective skin soothing product but don't want to break the bank.  The difference is usually what else is in it and sometimes a little difference in texture.. This one is the lightest of all that I have tried, leans more gel like. It is nice and light- one I think is nice for summer. I think I prefer my slightly heavier, creamier one (But 3x pricier for same amount) for winter use-- when I need the extra support in cold, skin chapping weather.  OH yeh, this is good stuff for lips too. It isn't a huge tube, so it could be carried in a coat pocket or purse, no problem.\",\n",
       "  'Oops! I didn\\'t realize when I ordered this that it says, \"medium\" in the product description, which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don\\'t see an option for any other tint level, so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle, BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink, with cool undertones. Still, I likely won\\'t use this by itself. It blends in, but it gives me a slight tanned look, \"a sun kissed glow\".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..<br /><br />This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen, using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays, converts them to heat, then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available, blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great, and it depends on what works best with  your skin.<br /><br />This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious, skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter, jojoba, oilve oil, and vitamin e. It comes out thin, and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round, and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often, sweating it off, etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized, I feel better about keeping it so simple.<br /><br />Again, I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn\\'t notice the \"medium\" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a \"sun kissed glow\". If that is at all appealing to you, then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool, fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast, at all. If your skin is real oily, then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin; seems to absorb. It doesn\\'t feel heavy, and it doesn\\'t feel like... sunscreen. It is light.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive, non-acne Rosacea (redness, visible veins), I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year, and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else, it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot, and try a lot.. if I don\\'t like it for my face & neck, then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try, and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).<br /><br />I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new, or think of anything else.',\n",
       "  'I am a big fan of Neogen products, and Korean beauty products in general. I like that the focus tends to be on creating healthy glowing skin through skin loving ingredients and maximizing hydration, which all skin types need. I find these Neogen Real Charcoal Pads to be super gentle, non irritating, lightly hydrating, skin brightening, deep cleaning of pores and other yucks on skin. Skin never ever tight, never irritated-- and I have non acne ROSACEA (flushing, telangiectasias/veins).<br /><br />I hadn\\'t used the charcoal pads before, so I was excited to try them out. There are 60 pads in a tub with twist off lid. One side of the pad is quilted and you can clearly see the charcoal coloring. The other side is smooth. The pads are quite damp, and there is plenty of product on them to take care of face and neck, or to use as a targeted \"sheet mask\". Avoid eye area.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: AFTER washing, swipe the quilted side over skin. Then use smooth side to pick up traces of impurities. Pat in remaining essence.<br /><br />When I swipe the quilted side over my skin, I like to go slow with gentle pressure. I allow the product to sit for a moment before flipping the pad over to the smooth side (more white than gray) and wipe my face. One side applies the product, the other helps to lift up what is left behind- or brought to surface as it is meant to draw out impurities and wastes. I noticed that the pad was turning tan/brownish leading me to believe that these pads were indeed doing a good job of breaking down excess junk on my face (despite a good cleansing) and leaving my skin feeling supple and clean. I followed the directions that state to pat in any excess product. I wasn\\'t sure whether to follow up with my hydrating toners, or skip to my Hyaluronic Acid (HA). Since skin needs moisture to make HA most effective, I patted on one layer of hydrating toner, a layer of HA, followed by a moisturizer to help lock in the hydration. I think this charcoal pad is gentle enough to use daily, if need be. However, I have been using it 2-3x a week. You will have to experiment to see what is best for you. My 40 something rosacea skin is sensitive, leans dry, and loves hydration. My skin can use an occasional boost in really purifying my pores and such. I am really liking this product so far. It just feels so gentle on my skin!<br /><br />Benefits, and a little more info:<br /><br />--Charcoal powder and peeling essence ingredient- Hydroxycinnamic Acid- provide double synergy effect for absorbing sebum and removing dead skin cells. The charcoal powder delivers gentle yet effective adsorption benefit to draw impurities, while hypoallergenic peeling essence (Hydroxycinnamic Acid) provides manual exfoliation combined with chemical peeling effect.<br /><br />--Manual exfoliation + chemical peeling effect.<br />--With two sides including Charcoal pad that cleanses the skin and embossing pad that softly purifies the skin.<br /><br />--Pore clarifying: Formulated with natural Peat water and Charcoal powder(310 ppm), these help to draw deep-seated sebum, whiteheads, dead skin cells, and other impurities out of pores for smoother and clearer skin.<br /><br />--Gentle Peeling: NEOGEN PHA‚Ñ¢ removes dead skin cells and impurities without irritation or discomfort while leaving the skin radiantly hydrated and smooth.

       "  'This is my second scrub with this company. The first was great, but I find that the fragrance is too much for me with this Honey one. These products do contain \"parfum\" as an added ingredient, but it is last on the list. I have included a picture of the ingredients as I do not see the list anywhere else. My other salt scrub by this company-bloodorange, and that scent is wonderful and fresh, in bottle, in shower, and on skin after (very light). This one is just heavy, rather perfume like. I have noticed some shea containing products have that, but the other one that I do like has shea as well but isn\\'t cloying. So I don\\'t know. I\\'m afraid it might trigger a headache for me. I may have to have someone else in the household finish it off. Love the other one I mentioned, though!<br /><br />As for how it works- no problem. A thick frosting like creamy texture with a hint of grit. It does a nice job cleaning, polishing, and leaving the skin feel smooth and moisturized. It is a gentle scrub- very gentle. Definitely softens skin. I scoop out a generous 1/8-1/4 cup amount to use on my body. With that amount, I expect several uses from this squat container. I particularly like this one for my legs and feet as they are the most neglected in terms of skin care.<br /><br />I really do like Natural Soultion salt scrubs, and it appears that there are 4 kinds. This one based solely on the fragrance is a miss for me, but another one happened to be a hit for me, which I will continue to use as needed.<br /><br />EDIT: While a whiff from the container is too strong for me, the actual aroma in the shower continues to be pretty tame. It dawned on me to smell my skin after showering (something I didn\\'t do with prior showers prior to initial review), and my skin doesn\\'t have that strong smell that I note from the container. It smells pleasant and light, and I wanted to come back to say so.SO I just wanted to say that I haven\\'t had a headache, and I don\\'t actually smell like the scent from the container- I was concerned I would have that perfume smell. It isn\\'t there, thankfully.<br /><br />I\\'d boost it to a 5 rating, but the product descriptions says, \"No Artificial Fragrances Or Perfumes\", and \"parfum\" is on ingredient list- and doesn\\'t say where that is derived from.',\n",

I don't travel much but my husband does often for work- sometimes by plane often by car. Either way, he has to pack toiletries. With six squeeze bottles and 3 tubs, he has some and I have kept a few for my own use. The fact that they are BPA free food grade silicone opens up some options for use of these bottles- whether traveling or for out and about (work lunches!).\",\n",
       "  'WOW!! These are good. They are very similar in style to all the other dermaplaning razors out there, but they are longer than any I have used. The blade is just a hair under 2\". Pun intended. One of the popular blades among beauty conscious people (pictured) is around 1.5\". Many are 1\" or less. SO, keep this in mind for where you want to use this and if you are comfortable with that length of blade. Otherwise it is all very similar.<br /><br />I like that this 5 pack is contained within a box. Many are on a flat piece of cardboard with molded plastic around them. Makes it too easy to lose one, misplace one.. they just fall out of package when opened. This box will nicely store the remainder. I won\\'t lose these among my other beauty goodies.<br /><br />I have no idea what it says on the box. The sticker on the box says Made in China. The box says, Made in Japan. I can\\'t read anything else.<br /><br />Handle is short- I think adds to precision of use. The longer blade makes it harder to get the eyebrow area. For that, I would go with a smaller, angled razor. For larger areas of face (or other body areas), this large blade is nice. As with any blade, BE CAREFUL. And don\\'t over use it- a dull blade can be as dangerous and damaging as a sharp blade.<br /><br />The blade is indeed sharp. I usually use a regular razor (like for shaving legs) to shave my face. I have pale skin and dark hair, so I have always preferred to just shave off my hair. No, it doesn\\'t grow back thicker or darker. But it sure makes the face nice and smooth- great for make up looking good, for skin care setting in nicely, for exfoliation- for overall health of skin. A leg razor is fine, less likely to cut.. but a straight razor provides an extra close shave (if careful). I love these for taking care of upper lip area, and for eyebrow area.. but is taking some getting used to since it is a longer blade than others I use.',\n",

       "  'I use a larger plug in water flosser unit in my full bathroom (on upper level of house) which has a large capacity water reservoir. I typically take my time and use it at night before bed. However, I wanted a unit on my main floor bathroom for quick use during the day without having to go back upstairs, or for use if I am going to be gone all day and want to take it with me. Therefor I have been keen on getting a portable chargeable flosser. That, and my first floor bathroom is super tiny with nowhere to put a typical flossing unit nor anywhere to plug it in. This is perfect for me!<br /><br />Nice unit, right out of the box. It is attractive, feels comfortable in the hand, as is easy to get it going. While it comes with instructions, it is easy to figure out- very intuitive. USB cord is good length. The port that plugs into the unit has a pop-in cover (\"anti-fouling rubber stopper\"). It doesn\\'t come attached, and I wish it did since I\\'d rather not have that area exposed to water. I sense that I will lose that cap soon enough, or just forget to use it. We\\'ll see.<br /><br />The unit comes with four attachments, all for doing different jobs- so unless someone has a need for this unit and for an attachment for something different than what you need, I would say this is for solo use. Good sized water reservoir, too.<br /><br />Unlike my main unit, this one has a fairly straight nozzle in comparison. This makes it a challenge to get behind the rear most molars. If the nozzles were a little longer, with slightly more curve than it has, I would consider this a perfect product.',\n",
       "  'I waited a little while after trying out this product to write a review. I was super curious about it, and I was hoping that it was something amazing that I may have overlooked in my skin care routine. I read that it is way more effective than an eyebrow razor. Then I tried it, and it made me laugh. It is not better. I don\\'t want to sound cynical, but I really don\\'t want  you to spend money where you don\\'t have to.  See, Do It Yourself/DIY deplaning is pretty much shaving. Don\\'t let this more expensive \"deplaning tools\" state otherwise. I would either buy any regular shaver of your choice, and/or use one of the smaller eyebrow shaver tools. Check  out Youtube and see all the people using the latter for this purpose. This is NOT salon level. Putting it in a pretty pink box and seeing single blades in an awkward razor handle (sorry, \"WAND\") does not justify expense. Even if it were as cheap as a typical razor, or eyebrow/facial razor, I still would not recommend, which I will get to.<br /><br />If you take a look on Amazon, more and more of the eyebrow/facial razors are coming out, with longer lengths, and with the hot word, \"deplaning\" in the description. Despite the product description/cautionary tale- eyebrow razors are sharp enough, as well as regular razors. Seriously, if you are looking to remove thicker hair or even peach fuzz, one of these cheaper tools will work. This is trying to fit that niche, but with a fancier presentation. Don\\'t fall for it. Schick has regular razors and the small eyebrow/facial razors that will do the job.<br /><br />Why do I say all this? because I shave EVERY day. I use a regular razor (I think 3 blade) on the large parts of my face, and the smaller eyebrow/facial razor (single blade) for smaller areas (thought these areas only need to be attended to once in awhile). I am a female in my 40s and I have been shaving since I was in my teens. I have dark hair and very light skin, with a propensity toward excess hair all over, so any hair on my face stands out. I never cared for that (shocker), and NO, shaving never ever creates more hair, or thicker, or whatever. What shaving (or call it \"deplaning\") does do is clean up the face and exfoliate. Shaving isn\\'t just for guys!<br /><br />Anyway, I used this on one side of my face, and use my other typical tools on the other. I preferred outcome with my typical tools. I tried it over the course of a few days, so I could give it a chance and determine if I learned anything new. But I kept coming back with same result- this is no better, and even less effective than my regular razor and/or little eyebrow facial razor.<br /><br />When I tried this product, I was thinking that maybe I would get an even closer shave. Nope, not even close. I tried it according to the meager directions- use on a dry face. Not impressed. Thinking maybe I could do better with a damp face, I tried that- definitely not. I pulled skin taut, I made sure product was pressed firmly but gently, I tried short strokes, I tried long strokes.. I worked the angle of the razor as recommended, and just found it hindered my sight, and it was hard to tell if I was getting anywhere with it. I went back and tried to research the product, or similar products, I tried to find videos- just nothing that made me think I was at all using it wrong. I am experienced with facial hair removal, and this is not what I will be using.<br /><br />One thing I do kinda like: I like that the handle is trying to make people use it at the correct angle- it takes a little getting used to. There is a tiny bit more fineness required with the small single razor eyebrow/facial razors, but I have never cut myself with one. I did nick myself with this. So maybe the guiding design isn\\'t great, after all?<br /><br />I want to clarify: General information on deplaning says not to use products for a couple of days and to only do this once a month or so. That is really just for professional level deplaning. If you are doing this at home, with what amounts to a regular razor, (no matter the size, or how it is packaged), once can and should use their products as usual, and shaving can be done daily. If you do not have much hair to remove, then just 1-2x a week should suffice. If you are a hairy beast like me, who could easily shave 1-2 times a day, then know that the degree of exfoliation provided in this manner does not require refraining from product use. Though, that is all dependent upon how your individual skin reacts.  Now, if you were getting this professionally done (the tools are different, and does a thorough job), then by all means follow directions of your technician.<br /><br />What\\'s in box: 2 handles, with two razors (ie, \"deplaning blade\") in each handle (ie; \"wand\"). A little brush to clean out hair that will build up. Not extra razors. Not protective cover to keep them sharp. I don\\'t expect them to last long- it is just a single razor, nothing special. The \"wands\" do not appear able to have the razor swapped out. Instructions are same as the \"instructions for use\" listed in this product page. Basically a printed version.<br /><br />Hope this helped. Again, I don\\'t like to be so negative about a product, but this is one that I do not find more effective than what it is trying to replace.',\n",
       "  \"It doesn't perfectly straighten the hair, but it definitely smooths it out, getting it pretty close to straight. The crush style straightener is pretty easy to use. It will take a little getting used to over using a flat plate straightener. I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to use it on my long, thick, wavy hair.. but I had no trouble with it. My first time using it was on not freshly washed hair- maybe a day or two after last shampoo. I used a little thermal protector, and then started swiping the brush through my hair. It took longer than using a flat plate to get hair smoothed out, but I do like the natural looking results. I like the ability to use a fine water mist- this helps to smooth out the hair.\",\n",
       "  \"Jade roller and jade scraper comes in pleasant looking box with a small bag to store these items in. It would make for a nice gift. Product claims to be made of real jade, which I looked for in making my decision.<br /><br />The jade roller feels good on the face, especially when first being used due to the coolness of the stone. I wouldn't normally buy something like this, but I already massage my face a little every day (fluid build up), so I thought this would be an interesting way to change things up.<br /><br />Again, I love the feel of the cool stone rolling across my face. I have rosacea and it just feels so comforting on my reddened skin. I haven't been real consistent with its use so I can not attest to how effective it is in terms of benefits to the skin. It does provide a gentle massage, which is good for draining lymph nodes and helping to reduce swelling. I am using it before I put on moisturizers, etc, as per recommendation on instructions. It says using this before hand will help the products work better. In my 40s with barely emerging fine lines, I am all for doing what I can to keep those at bay.<br /><br />As I learn anything new, I will add to my review.\",\n",

       "  '[[VIDEOID:7cfc995b010d23bc7176b91f843fecfa]] Hotep and party on brothers and sisters and thank you for looking at my review of the HMPRT 80s 90s Costume, A Black Mullet Rocker Wig and Wig Cap, Black T-Shirt, Wayne‚Äôs World Baseball Cap, and Inflatable Guitar. What I like about this set it\\'s a spoof of Wayne\\'s World and it comes with a Wayne\\'s World cap, a wig, T shirt and an inflatable guitar. The inflatable guitar gives a whole new meaning to the term air guitar. With this you can play Bohemian Rhapsody! ‚ÄúNOT‚Äù Long live, Queen.<br />‚ÄúWayne\\'s World\" was originally a recurring sketch from the NBC television series Saturday Night Live. It evolved from a segment titled \"Wayne\\'s Power Minute\" (1987) on the CBC Television series It\\'s Only Rock & Roll, as the main character first appeared in that show. A prototype of the Wayne character had appeared several years prior on CITY-TV in Toronto\\'s overnight show City Limits. The Saturday Night Live sketch spawned a hit 1992 film, its 1993 sequel, and several catchphrases which have since entered the pop-culture lexicon. The sketch centered on a local public-access television program in Aurora, Illinois, hosted by Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers, the same actor from \"Wayne\\'s Power Minute\"), an enthusiastic and sardonic long-haired metalhead, and his timid and sometimes high-strung, yet equally metal-loving sidekick and best friend, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey). Wayne lives with his parents and broadcasts his show \"live\" from the basement of their house every Friday evening at 10:30. The first \"Wayne\\'s World\" sketch appeared in the 13th Saturday Night Live episode of the 1988/1989 season. The only thing I didn\\'t like about the Cap is that it clearly looks like a woven Cap on the ad, but the Cap that I was sent is definitely a screen print which I guess is, OK?  ‚Äù NOT‚Äù.

So, while these are super stinking cute, they don't really work holding your hair without breaking.\",\n",

Well, now I don't have to keep buying those because this cuticle pusher is awesome and made out of stainless steal. It has a really awesome design, a very nice weight so that it stays in the hand and also can be used to clean out from under the nails too.<br /><br />I really do love using this though. I always give it a little wipe with an alcohol pad and then do what I need to do. I use the curved ended down to push my cuticles back and then use it face up to clean out from under my nails, because lets face it. It doesn't matter what you do, stuff is still gonna get up in there and you have to clean it out every so often.<br /><br />Anyway, works great and totally worth the price.

I used it just like the instructions said and it smoothed out the small lines at the corner of my eyes and under the eyes. It completely reduced the size of my pores on my nose, which are usually very large. I mean, it made my face look great but the real test was how did my make up look over this stuff. Well, it looked wonderful. It made my make up go on smoother than ever before and the real test was the fact it not only lasted all day but even all night until I washed my face.

What I really like is that this set of tools and inclusions comes in a multi-level box that is transparent. It is easy to see what inclusions are inside, which is very easy to use while working on a project. Pipettes are really great to remove bubbles and also to apply very small amounts of resin into detailed areas. The silicone mat is essential to protect a working surface and the tweezers are very useful to add small items into a poured resin piece. There are also extra 30ml mixing cups, tiny spoons and wooden sticks.<br /><br />These inclusions are great to use with other materials besides resin like nail art, decoupage glues, acrylic paint and polymer clay. This makes the set versatile for working with different mediums and for different projects. There are full round hole-less beads and also half beads. I really like the tiny seashells, my set also includes a tiny starfish. I am putting these into a resin painting with some sand I saved from a recent beach vacation. The only thing included with this set that is not useful to me are the finger cots, as I prefer to wear gloves when working with resin. The only negative aspect is very small, but some glitter was loose. I did not find this to be bothersome, but did want to mention that. There is a lot of supplies in this kit and I consider it to be a really great value for all that is included. I hope that my experience is helpful as you kindly click the button below.',\n",

       "  'There are pros and cons to the Tirtyl Hand Soap Sheet Variety Pack. I found it difficult to get a decent lather from the sheets, even when using 2 or 3 at a time. This makes them less than ideal for bathing. However, I did get them to do a great job for cleaning just my hands. I would suggest them for cleaning hands while on the go. The scent is very light when added to water. A tin is included, which is a bit more durable than the paper envelopes. The tin slides open, matchbox style. I would recommend using the tin as it will withstand being transported in a pocket, purse or bag better than the paper envelopes. If you anticipate being exposed to rain, I would suggest to place the tin and/or envelopes into a plastic bag. Using water and friction is superior to using hand sanitizer, and with the soap sheets you will be able to maintain much cleaner hands while out and about.<br /><br />If you are looking for a portable soap for bathing, I would still suggest to use bar soap wrapped in wax paper inside a plastic bag. If you are in situations where you need to wash hands without soap provided, these are ideal for that need. I would recommend the soap sheets as they are easy to transport and cost effective for hand washing. I hope you find my experience helpful and kindly will click the button below.',\n",

I cannot recommend the kit if this is the primary component of the kit you want. I would suggest looking elsewhere. On the other hand, the amount of glue rings, wands and microbrushes prove to be very useful to me. If you are after the accessories, then this is a fair value. I have no strong opinion about the pads or scrapers. Overall, this is not a product I would recommend, but if you are after the accessories in the kit, then I would say this is a decent kit to have those on hand.

All my razors were expensive, they were all the best in the bunch.  This is the best by far.<br /><br />This razor shaves close, I have never felt my skin so smooth except when I used to use a blade.  It conforms to your skin, even my neck comes out smooth (about 4 minutes to completely shave smooth, or I'll usually shave for less than a minute and get a shave that lasts until I get home from work).  It has a timer that not only tells you exactly how many minutes of battery are left, but it also tells you how many minutes you shaved for (which comes in handy more than I thought it would).  The best feature is that you can pop the top up and rinse it in water!  My brauns cleaned with refil cartridges that were hard to find and expensive and a hassel; whereas my old Norelco cleaned with a brush and never got really clean.  This one cleans easily and quickly, and even beeps to tell you when to clean it!  Also, this razor doesn't give me razor burn like my Brauns did!!<br /><br />If you are a first time shaver, or an expierenced shaver looking for a better shave from an electric razor, this is the one for you!

Obviously, I understand any treatment such as this, requires extended daily use to achieve the results I‚Äôm seeking, but based on my initial findings I‚Äôm confident it will work.<br /><br />This is an excellent product that I absolutely recommend. I look forward to using more Merlot products in the future as I found this serum superb.',\n",
       "  \"This product makes brushing my Goldendoodle so much easier.<br /><br />It arrived very quickly and is exactly as described.<br /><br />It is made to fit on the right hand and has a Velcro type wrist cuff that can be tightened so it doesn't slip around. The plastic tipped bristles cover the entire palm and thumb area making it so you brush large areas with every stroke.<br /><br />It is made from a breathable fabric which makes it comfortable and cool to wear.<br /><br />Hair pulls out of the bristles easily when finished brushing so it can be left clean for the next grooming.<br /><br />It is well made and should last a long time.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this purchase.\",\n",

Absolutely gorgeous color!<br /><br />Be warned it did slightly stain my sink and bathtub, but a good foaming bathroom cleaner, some elbow grease, and a bit of time made quick work of getting rid of it.<br /><br />The scent is very pleasant, and I also really enjoyed the ease of use and coverage of the dye.<br /><br />I highly recommend doing a small patch test to make sure it's a color that will look good on you.<br /><br />The dye came out exactly like the label on the package, absolutely beautiful.\",\n",

The smaller roller is really nice to roll over eyes. Feels great! I wish everything felt weighted though. I think there are much better options out there.',\n",

       "  \"I don't know if this is helping my hair regrowth but, I feel like it's helping my spider veins. It's easy to hold even for extended periods of time. It's not a rechargeable product. It must be plugged in while using. It is painless. I don't wear the super dark glasses. I just close my eyes. I use on underarm too. I will keep it up, I'm just sorta lazy.\",\n",
       "  'Wonderful lip balm. Creamy, not waxy and stayed put. Smells luscious and sweet. I feel like this hydrates for at least an hour too. No stinging upon application. The lids audibly \"clicks\" when closed so you know it shut. 45 spf too.',\n",
       "  \"This serum is so very very good! Smells warm and woodsy in a way, not floral or soapy. Very viscous, medium-heavy. The dropper only dispenses about 4 drops, which is enough for face and neck. I use a roller after applying too, which I highly recommend. I'm happy with the glow and hydration my skin has. The longer I use it, the better my skin looks.\",\n",
       "  \"My 14 yo is using this set and she loves it. The mascara is a deep black and it doesn't flake off. She also has had no problems removing this product with just a wet makeup wipe.  The curler has rubber grips at the end so it is easy for her to hold and use. Very happy with this.\",\n",
       "  'This masks works great! My hair is blonde and fine and tends to go brassy if not processed correctly. Using this mask is an easy way to freshen and brighten. Not too thick, almost whipped in texture. Totally moisturizes and rinses out without heavy residue.',\n",
       "  'Very decent bamboo toothbrush. Generally the bristles are too soft for me. This one is medium-soft. So at least it feels like my mouth is clean after brushing. Lightweight, no guilt. Even the packaging is made from recycled material. Great to have multi pack!',\n",
       "  \"This is such a high end product. The weighted compact feels sleek and heavy in your hand. The slide/pivot opening is clever and works smooth. The color saturation is rich and deep and looks flawless on many skin tones. Not too much shimmer, so it actually looks like you've been sun kissed after application. Buildable color if you want a more intense look. You can use both colors together, which is what I do. I am medium complexion, blonde, 48 years old. This product doesn't increase pores size, nor does it settle into any wrinkles. In my opinion, deserving of more than 5 stars.\",\n",
       "  \"I love oil based cleansers and don't use anything else. But they are not for everyone. My 20 year old daughter doesn't like this product, while I think it's one of the best I've used. The smell is subtle and I love the suppleness of my skin after cleaning!\",\n",
       "  \"Of all the extensions I've ordered, this is my least favorite. The blonde has so much brass in it! It's almost red in color. (I put a few pictures with my review. The lighter blonde is the color that I expect when I order blonde.) There are also more dark black strands coursing thru these pieces than any other brand I've used. Maybe it's just this particular color?  Comes with clips, which is nice. And hair is soft.\",\n",
       "  'I only received 1 tube of eyelash serum. I apply it right at my lash line, as directed, on a clean face. Have not seen any notable  difference. Does not sting or irritate my eyes.',\n",
       "  \"This stuff is wonderful. It's been a game changer for my hands this winter. There is very little scent. Which suprised me because it's filled with so many natural extracts like apple, lemon, carrot, aloe, grapefruit.  The directions suggest to put on before bed and slip cotton gloves on. I'm not planning on doing that because I'm not 80, but am still very impressed at how long my hands feel protected and moisturized.\",\n",
       "  \"There's not a lot of salt in here to make it exfoliate very well. That said, it moisturizes and hydrates beautifully. Everything dissolves and washes off completely and it smells so light and fresh!\",\n",

       "  \"There are no instructions on how to care for the hair extensions nor are there instructions on how to securely put on the halo filament wire (actually a strong, clear plastic line that has 5 adjustable positions AND you get extra wire and snap-in-place comb fasteners).<br /><br />I had to search YouTube for directions on how to place it securely. I'm still working on getting it the correct size for my head size. I have very thin hair which might be the problem.<br /><br />There are tons of videos about different hairstyles with halo hair extensions. Plus lots of different updos because YES you can have an updo -- buns, pony tails, braiding etc, -- with these extensions.<br /><br />Much easier to brush/comb you hair with the halo than with taped extensions. It is NOT itchy like most wigs I've invested in.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!\",\n",
       "  'I love this stuff, especially for the price. I was looking for a benetint dupe. This has 3x the color payoff for a fraction of the price. I haven‚Äôt noticed much plumping action, but the color is so pretty that it doesn‚Äôt matter much to me. It smells great and I think it would look good on most skin types so long as you are comfortable with bright reds. My only complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt fade evenly but I mean, what lip product does?',\n",

No, it won't pass as real hair, at this price point I wasn't expecting it to. But I must admit that I'm impressed at the quality for the price. My wife was able to wear it all day and didn't find it uncomfortable at all, and we both loved how she looks in it. Very pleased!\",\n",

So now when you take the brush out of the tube there‚Äôs gobs of mascara on the brush. You have to wipe it off of the brush with a tissue or it can‚Äôt be applied.

These however are large enough and strong enough to hold all of her hair back.<br /><br />You get a nice variety of 12 different colors and they come in a pretty purple box. They work great for clipping back all of the hair, or in small sections as well when straightening.',\n",
       "  'This 4 pack of travel lotions by Spanature is super nice, from the presentation of the product, to the performance of the product. They come packaged soooo nicely in 4 little gift boxes, so they are perfect for gift giving. Also, the tubes are the perfect size to fit in your purse- so they are great for on the go or even traveling!<br /><br />The lotion itself is very moisturizing, and not greasy at all. The green tea scent is not strong at all, which is perfect if you are sensitive to strong scents.',\n",
       "  'This mannequin head is great for the price. It includes the clamp, and the hair is very thick. The hair is not real human hair, it‚Äôs synthetic... so it doesn‚Äôt curl very good like real human hair.<br /><br />It is great for trying out new hair styles though, even for practicing hair cutting. It comes with 2 clips and rubber bands as well.',\n",

But, with these practice makes perfect.<br /><br />They come with 2 tubes of magnetic eyeliner (black), and 10 sets of eyelashes along with the application tool. When you apply the magnetic eyeliner, you have to be precise. The eyeliner is black, and will look very dark if you do too thick of a line. I would do thinner lines if possible, with about 2 layers so that the eyeliner is not overwhelming. Once the eyeliner dries, use the application tool to put the lashes on.<br /><br />It does feel a bit strange at first (if false lashes are new to you), and it may tickle around your eyes when you blink. But yes, these really work! With more practice my wife will get better at this.<br /><br />The only thing is that the magnetic eyeliner does not come off easily. You will need a good eye makeup remover to get this off as it‚Äôs waterproof!',\n",

The box looks like a gift box, so these would make a great gift for someone special! ‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><br />The bath bombs are scented with essential oils and are very moisturizing. Each bath bomb is wrapped in tissue paper and labeled. The packaging is just amazing!<br /><br />The scents are strong, so these may not work for you if you are sensitive to strong scents.

The largest hollowed our brush is great for blow drying. The smaller comb/brush is designed to remove tangles from curly hair, and it works well when using with detangling spray. There is a small attachment included, which hooks onto the back of the brush to keep the bristles together. You also get a wide tooth comb and a parting comb. Everything included in the set is lightweight and easy to hold. It‚Äôs a great set at an amazing price!',\n",

It‚Äôs good that it does not irritate my wife‚Äôs sensitive skin at all. She has tried on her lashes and has noticed a slight difference in the thickness of them. I am sure that time will bring more dramatic results. The product is a bit pricey for the amount you get though.',\n",

My skin has always been good, and I have taken care of it for most of my life, so I had a good place to start from, but I am beginning to see the crowsfoot lines fading, the dark shadows fading, and the general quality of skin even nicer.<br />FYI I am very fair skinned (red hair, white skin, green eyes type of Irish) so not sure how it would work on dark skin, especially African, but it doesn't feel like it's corrosive so might be OK.<br />You really only need a fingerprint's worth for each eye area, so it is going to last a long time.  In 2 months I am less than half way through the jar.\",\n",
       "  'WOW a comb that is truly smooth and seam-free, does not snag my long wavy hair, and smells nice.  Seems to work well on wet and dry hair.  It seems very sturdily made, but I am going to buy another just in case.  I just wish they made one with longer tins, as the heavy duty plastic one I had been using before had longer tines and it felt good going through my hair especially when wet.
